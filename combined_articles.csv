0,"Jun 14, 2024",The world is going to need more gold,"(Kitco News) - Last week, we warned investors that gold’s selloff was an overreaction to misunderstood fundamental news.
Blackbox (algorithmic trading) gold traders, who have been relying on Chinese central bank buying, were spooked when data from the People’s Bank of China showed that it didn’t increase its reserves last month, ending an 18-month shopping spree.
Gold managed to hold critical support at $2,300 on Monday and is seeing a 1% gain on the week heading into the weekend.
Given all the geopolitical uncertainty around the world, it is ludicrous to think that China is done buying gold.
This week, I attended the 30th annual Montreal Conference of the International Economic Forum of the Americas, which helped me better understand the growing trend of deglobalization.
“It’s extraordinary to me to see how rapidly we've moved from a situation where globalization seemed inevitable to where today it increasingly seems impossible,” said Perrin Beatty, a former Progressive Conservative Cabinet Minister and President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, during a panel discussion.
While the U.S. dollar is expected to remain the world’s reserve currency, it will face growing competition. 
Analysts constantly reiterate that gold will play a growing role in a multipolar currency world because it remains one of the most liquid monetary assets in global financial markets.
We can already see the U.S. dollar’s diminished role on the world stage. This week, the trade agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which established the petrodollar, was allowed to expire.
For the past 50 years, the U.S. dollar has dominated global trade as the two nations agreed to price oil in U.S. dollars. This agreement cemented the dollar as the world’s reserve currency and ushered in an era of prosperity for 
Americans; in exchange, the U.S. provided military support and protection to the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia’s moves to expand beyond the USD come as it enters a new trading bloc with expanded BRICS nations: Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.
During the Montreal conference, Ali Borhani, Managing Director of 3Sixty Strategic Advisors Ltd and co-founder and host of the BRI Dialogues, put the expanded trading bloc into perspective and noted that people have to recognize that the world has changed.
“Half of the world population is in BRICS+. Two-thirds of world trade happens in BRICS+. BRICS are adding 74 million consumers a year. That is two times Canada out of these markets,” Borhani said during the panel discussion. 
“The largest buyers of energy and the largest sellers of energy happen to be in the Global South and among BRICS. So we're looking at the rewiring of energy, finance, supply chain, and tech.”
Because of these broad-reaching geopolitical shifts, it is fairly easy to make a simple case for gold as a global currency. Many analysts have noted that gold remains the best neutral asset to settle trade imbalances.
So it's not just China that is going to have to buy more gold; nations around the world, especially those in emerging markets that have relied so heavily on the U.S. dollar, will have to rebuild their gold reserves.
That is it for this week. Have a great weekend."
1,"Jun 14, 2024",Gold looks good again next week as both Wall Street and Main Street turn bullish,"
(Kitco News) – After last week's price action was dominated by Friday’s news from China and the employment report, precious metals markets were squarely focused on inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate path this week. 
After kicking off the week trading at $2,293.70 per ounce during the Sunday evening Asian session, spot gold broke above the $2,300 level about two hours before the North American market open, and that level held throughout the rest of the week's roller coaster ride. 
Gold prices chopped along in a relatively narrow $15 channel as market participants waited for Wednesday, which would bring the consumer inflation report in the morning, then the FOMC rate announcement, updated economic projections, and Chair Powell's press conference in the afternoon. 
The CPI report finally shook the market out of its sideways trading, spiking spot gold from $2,313 per ounce just before the data release to its weekly high of $2,336.72 immediately afterward. By the time the Federal Reserve announced that they were keeping rates unchanged at 2:00 p.m., the price had pulled back to $2,326 per ounce, and spot gold continued to sell off steadily as markets digested Powell’s hawkish rhetoric and the FOMC's updated projection of only one rate cut in all of 2024.
By Thursday, spot gold had once again slid back down to support, but it saw a firm bounce just below the $2,300 level and by Friday morning the yellow metal was once again marching higher into the weekend. 

The latest Kitco News Weekly Gold Survey has a majority of industry experts and retail traders seeing green for gold prices next week as they emerge from their bearish hibernation and return to bullish pastures.
“Gold snapped a three-week decline, encouraged by political uncertainty in Europe, and a sharp drop in interest rates,” said Marc Chandler, Managing Director at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It recovered about half of what it lost after the US jobs data on June 7 and on reports that the PBOC did not buy gold for reserves last month.”
Chandler noted that spot gold traded to around $2841 in the middle of last week before consolidating. “Gold was relatively restrained, perhaps pulled by conflicting signals—of a stronger dollar on the one hand, and lower rates on the other. Trendline resistance begins the new week near $2362. On a medium-term view, I suspect gold is nearer a bottom than a top and expected lower interest rates to underpin the yellow metal.”
“I’m sticking with ‘up’ for this week as bulls put in a strong defense of $2300,” said James Stanley, senior market strategist at Forex.com. “The pullbacks are getting more concerning, however, as that shows bulls taking advantage of strength to realize profits and square up positions. That’s helped to build a possible head and shoulders pattern. That formation requires a breach of the neckline, but if it does then I think we could be soon looking at a deeper pullback scenario. And for that, I’m tracking the longer-term range resistance, around the $2,075-$2,082 level for longer-term support to play in.”
“For now, support remains in play and I’m biasing bullish, but I’m ready to change if the neckline breaks,” Stanley said.
“Up,” said Adrian Day, President of Adrian Day Asset Management. “Gold is recovering from last week’s sell-off as U.S. economic news has been more ‘dovish’ – weaker producer inflation numbers and higher claims for unemployment – both helping the case for a cut in interest rates, and geopolitical tensions heighten – more attacks on Israel from Hezbollah and Russian warships in the Caribbean.”
“I am bullish on Gold for next week,” said Colin Cieszynski, Chief Market Strategist at SIA Wealth Management. “It’s looking ready for a technical bounce up off of support.”
Sean Lusk, co-director of commercial hedging at Walsh Trading, was reflecting on what traders had learned from both last week and this one.
“I think this recent drop is just a reflection of two things in gold,” Lusk said. “Obviously, last week China just shot an arrow across the bow when nobody was looking, that they were backing off some gold purchases. They said that stuff so they can buy it cheaper, that’s how I view that. And China can say whatever the hell they want, but they have to back up all their money printing.”
“We also had what was deemed to be a blowout unemployment report by some media outlets,” he said. “What a laughable joke that was; not a blowout employment report, it wasn't even close to that. A lot of the gains were government-created, not in the private sector, and if you look within the numbers, and the revisions lower the prior two months, it wasn't that much of a gain, if any.”
Lusk said last Friday’s sharp correction downward wasn’t justified based on those releases. “But the market's going to do what it's going to do, and sometimes you can't fight it,” he said.
“Then CPI came in [this week], hit the dollar one day, and then they brought it back up on PPI,” Lusk observed. “It's just a mixed bag of nonsense, really. But I think for gold's price here, it's a pure consolidation. We held the weekly low down at $2,304. There's a lot of uncertainty all over the place, and I think that the path of least resistance for metals is still higher.”
Lusk said that since last Friday, the August futures contract dropped from $2,406 all the way to $2,304. “You dropped $100 in a day,” he noted. “That's pretty steep, right? But you haven't revisited that low. So now the key resistance is going to be that big ‘drop day’ high. You can draw a trend line from the May high the week before Memorial Day weekend at $2,477 to $2,406. Wherever that line's coming in, that's your trend line that you’ve got to watch. If they blow through last Friday morning's high before China made that announcement, then we're going up to $2,485, if not $2,500.”
“Now, should we blow through $2,304, then we're going down to $2,280 and we might go down to $2,200,” he cautioned. “But I think the trend is still up overall, no doubt about that. You've come off the highs a little bit, but you've had a hell of a run since the February lows. From $1,996 you ran up to $2,454 on the continuous. That’s a $458 move in three months.”
This week, 13 Wall Street analysts participated in the Kitco News Gold Survey, and after this week’s performance, they were considerably more optimistic about the precious metal’s near-term prospects. Eight experts, representing 62%, expect to see gold prices climb higher next week, while only two analysts, or 15%, predicted a price decline. The remaining three, or 23% of the total, expect gold to trade sideways during the coming week.
Meanwhile, 216 votes were cast in Kitco’s online poll, with Main Street investors somewhat more cautious than their institutional counterparts, but positive on balance. 117 retail traders, or 54%, look for gold prices to rise next week. Another 49, or 23%, expected the yellow metal to trade lower, while 50 respondents, representing the remaining 23%, saw prices chopping sideways during the week ahead.

With the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision in the books, markets will shift their focus to Europe next week as the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of England will both announce their monetary policy decisions on Thursday morning.
Markets will also receive the Empire State manufacturing index on Monday, and retail sales for May on Tuesday. Then, Thursday brings housing starts and building permits for May, as well as weekly jobless claims and the Philly Fed manufacturing index. The week’s data wraps up with existing home sales on Friday morning.
Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst at Barchart.com, expects gold to build on this week’s rebound and make further gains. “While August gold’s intermediate-term trend remains down, its short-term trend has turned up,” he said. “This means the contract should take out its previous high of $2,358.80 with the next upside target near $2,370, then $2,391.”
“As we head into the weekend, I’m looking for increased investment buying tied to the political chaos in France,” Newsom added. “We can’t call it a Black Swan event given it was predictable as the China/Russia coalition gets more desperate ahead of the global 2024 election cycle.”
Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said he thinks gold’s support at $2,300 looks extremely fragile and unreliable.
“Firstly, last Friday, Gold went over 4% from peak to bottom, on high volumes and with a horrendous amplitude falling under the 50-day moving average,” he said. “All other dynamics of this week may well be considered as consolidation of liquidity by bears for a new blow to the metal. This thesis is reinforced by the fact that this 50-day average is already actively working as resistance.”
“Secondly, the dollar has been rising since last Friday, as if switching into a ‘buy on the downturn’ mode,” Kuptsikevich said. “The dollar index has pushed back from its 200-day moving average since the beginning of the month. And a rising dollar with attractive bond interest yields makes dollar bonds an effective competitor to gold.”
The third factor weighing on gold is the ongoing slide in stocks. “Separate from the short-squeeze-backed gains in individual stocks in the Nasdaq100 and S&P500, there is noticeable heaviness in the Dow Jones and Russell 2000 indices, not to mention the 5% loss by the French CAC40 for the week,” he said. “Politics was back to spooking the markets as we heard of new barrages of trade wars and the risks of increased protectionism.”
Adam Button, head of currency strategy at Forexlive.com, was also reflecting on the shifting political landscape and its short- and long-term implications for precious metals and the dollar.
“The consensus around open borders and open trade was built with the U.S. dollar at the heart of it,” Button said. “Breaking that system will have impacts, and we're seeing them, on the U.S. dollar, especially now that the U.S. is wielding tariffs as a tool. Trump the other day was talking about replacing income tax with tariffs. That's an attack on even a country like Canada, potentially. I don't think it's realistic, but 10 years from now, who knows? And what does 2028 look like? Does it look like two reasonable human beings in an election fight?”
“That's the way the pendulum is swinging,” he added. “And if it is, what are you doing holding Treasuries? When they say you're cheating on your tariffs, or you're cheating on imports, and they decide to steal your money, like they did to Russia?
“That seems outlandish, but in a world like that, what's gold worth?” Button asked. “$10,000? $20,000?”
Turning to Europe, Button said that the Franco-German consensus that has governed Europe since the dawn of the euro is ending. “What happens to the Eurozone from here? And the EU, what's the point of the whole thing if that's broken?” he asked. “We're seeing that in French bonds right now. It's not hard to envision the next German election, the next Hungarian election again, even the Dutch swung that way.”
“Political turmoil is the theme right now,” he said. “And that's a classic gold driver.”
That said, Button still doesn’t expect gold to rise in the near term. “Do I want to be long gold next week? No, I don't,” he said. “If something can't rally on good news, then it's not going to rally. That was the best CPI report that gold bulls could have hoped for, and gold didn't rally. It's having a decent day today, but maybe that's the push and pull of the political side.”
“I don't like the price action this week, that's what it comes down to for me,” Button added. “If $2,300 breaks, what's the downside? Probably like $2,150, something like that. Maybe I'm interested there.”
The other thing he’d like to see is whether gold prices can withstand some real pain in equities. 
“No one has forgotten how poorly gold did at the outset of COVID,” Button said. “And I'm not to say that we'll see equities puke like that, but it hasn't been a counter-cyclical trade. So I just want to see what gold looks like in a poor day for equities, a real poor day, which I think we're headed toward. We just need one bad NVIDIA headline. It's really carrying the whole market here.”
Michael Moor, Founder of Moor Analytics, was breaking down the technical picture from gold’s recent price action in the lower and higher timeframes.
“On a lower timeframe basis: The trade below 24343 (+1.3 tics per/hour) has brought in $130.1 of pressure,” Moor wrote. “The trade below 24216 (+4 tics per/hour) projects this downward $60 (+)—we have attained $117.4.  These rolled from (M) into the (Q).  The trade back below 23642 (-1.2 tics per/hour) in (Q) has brought in $60.0 of pressure.   Decent trade above 23489 (-1.2 tics per/hour starting at 7:00am) should bring in decent strength.”
“Areas of possible exhaustion to contend with below come in at 65216-4785, 62926, and 60280-59628; and we have entered into the ideal timeframe for one of these to hold more than temporarily - if we settle below the lower of these, this should be a larger, higher timeframe correction,” he said.
And Kitco Senior Analyst Jim Wyckoff holds a balanced view toward gold going into next week. “Choppy and sideways as bulls and bears are on a neutral near-term technical playing field,” he said.
Spot gold last traded at $2333.21 at the time of writing, up 1.26% on the day and 1.71% on the week.

2,"Jun 14, 2024",Gold price risks rise as head and shoulder pattern emerges,"
(Kitco News) - A new divergence between the Federal Reserve’s interest rate forecast and market expectations could create some volatility in the gold market in the near term. However, some analysts note that as the precious metal continues to consolidate, it will be more important to watch technical levels.
James Stanley, Senior Market Strategist at Forex.com, said that the fundamental outlook, dominated by geopolitical uncertainty and rising debt levels, remains supportive for gold. However, he added that the short-term technical outlook is a little more precarious, as the price action is forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern with a neckline support zone between $2,300 and $2,275.
“The neckline hasn’t broken yet. It’s been close but no cigar,” he said. “As long as the $2,300 area remains defended, I’m still bullish. I don't want to take a bearish stance on gold until we have that head and shoulders starting to fill in.”
Stanley’s cautious outlook comes as gold prices look to close the week with solid gains. August gold futures last traded at $2,349.50 an ounce, up 1% from last Friday’s close.
Stanley added that if gold breaks below his initial support levels, he would not be surprised to see prices fall all the way to $2,100 and retest critical support at $2,075, which was roughly a three-year resistance line prior to this year’s breakout.
Alex Kuptsikevich, Senior Market Analyst at FxPro, said that although gold has managed to hold support at $2,300 in its last two tests, this level is looking a little fragile. He noted that a combination of weak equity markets and a strong U.S. dollar could create some headwinds for the precious metal in the near term.
“In 2008, 2011, and 2020, the initial rise in the value of an ounce against a background of falling stocks and a rising dollar quickly reversed into a collapse in the gold price,” he said. “It is worth keeping a close eye on how events in the currency and stock market unfold. And if the risk-off continues, buying gold will be as dangerous as picking up pennies in front of a train.”
Although gold’s downside risk is growing, Stanley said that he expects a drop will create long-term value in the market.
“If I’m looking at gold a few years down the road, I am pretty sure that prices are going higher as the government continues to spend money and take on more debt,” he said. “A deeper pullback will create a long-term buying opportunity.”
However, other analysts are expecting gold to continue to shine as selling pressure in the equity market is due to geopolitical uncertainty. France’s snap election, called at the start of the week following the European Union elections, has roiled markets.
Investors fleeing French equities and bonds have pushed the spread between French and German 10-year yields to nearly 70 basis points, its widest level in seven years.
Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, said that this uncertainty is one reason why gold has held up against renewed momentum in the U.S. dollar.
“U.S. dollar strength, which normally should weigh on precious metal prices, has so far not materialized. The reason being the strength is driven by euro weakness after the French president shocked investors by calling a snap vote after his party suffered a crushing defeat in European parliamentary elections,” he said. “The market fears a repeat defeat to the far-right party could trigger a debt crisis, potentially adding support to gold from worried investors.”
Hansen said that he also expects gold to be well-supported as central banks remain stoic buyers, even after data from the People’s Bank of China showed it didn’t add any gold to its reserves last month.
“China, a major driver of the gold rally in the past year, is in our opinion nowhere near done buying gold, but the pause also highlights they are human, balking at the prospect of paying record prices. Also, the recent attention paid to Chinese private buying has likely thrust them into a spotlight they normally avoid,” he said.
Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst at City Index and founder of TradingCandles.com, said he sees gold’s rebound from last week’s selloff as a solid sign of strength as it continues to consolidate. He noted that there was no follow-through selling from last week, which saw the biggest drop in two years.
“A potential rally could be on the horizon now that the Fed meeting and CPI data are both out of the way. The bulls have pushed gold above short-term resistance at $2,330. Now an ideal scenario would be to push it past the short-term bearish trend line around $2,360,” he said. “However, the short-term XAUUSD forecast will become slightly bearish if there is another daily close below $2,300 in the week ahead, which could lead to further short-term selling toward the next support level at $2,222.”
The growing focus on gold’s technical price action comes ahead of a fairly light week for economic data.
Markets will receive some regional and preliminary manufacturing data and some housing data.
With the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision wrapped up, markets will turn their attention to Europe as the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of England will announce their monetary policy decisions next week.
The SNB was the first central bank to kick off the global easing cycle as it lowered interest rates at its previous meeting. Economists are expecting to see another cut.
In England, the BoE is expected to keep rates unchanged at 5.25%. However, analysts have said that they expect the central bank will start to lay the groundwork for an August cut.
Although the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to embark on an easing cycle as inflation remains elevated, many analysts have said that falling interest rates worldwide remain supportive for gold in the global context."
3,"Jun 14, 2024","Gold - the new reserve asset: Price target of $7k-$15k by 2030 is just a return to the ‘long-term average,’ Bitcoin at $420k? Luke Gromen","(Kitco News) - U.S. Treasuries will be dumped as global reserves by 2030 as the U.S. dollar gets re-priced from ""widely overvalued"" levels, triggering 3X returns in gold and 6X returns in Bitcoin, according to Luke Gromen, founder and president of Forest for the Trees (FFTT).
Gromen told Michelle Makori, lead anchor and editor-in-chief at Kitco News, that the economic policies of the past 40 years are intentionally being ""trashed"" in the U.S., which will have a massive impact on everything from U.S. Treasuries and the dollar to gold and Bitcoin.

Over the last few decades, the U.S. has become good at exporting Treasury bonds and bad at exporting everything else. This is what is changing right now, Gromen notes. 
""What Janet Yellen's telling you, what Jake Sullivan [National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan] is telling you, what the Department of Defense is telling you is that it's a national security interest to get out of the Treasury export business and to get into the stuff export business again,"" Gromen said. ""But we can't do that without a much weaker dollar, and the arbiter of that is going to be the price of gold. You're seeing U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen throw 40 years of economic orthodoxy in the trash."" 
This shift from Yellen, whose purview is the dollar, is significant. ""This is about as big as when [former President Richard] Nixon closed the gold window,"" Gromen described. In the future, ""the 130 trillion bond market is the sucker at the cards table.""
Gromen explains that the dollar system as we know it is dying, with the the U.S. treasury bond losing its position as the world's primary reserve asset. This is why the greenback will get re-priced. However, Gromen rules out that the USD will get replaced, stating that it will remain the global reserve currency. 
Watch the video above to find out why the U.S. dollar will be re-priced and not replaced as the global reserve currency and according to what. 
The new global reserve asset
The U.S. Treasury market has been losing its share as a primary global reserve asset since 2014 because global central banks have sold $400 billion worth of Treasuries on the net and bought $600 billion worth of gold on the net.
""Global central banks stopped buying U. S. Treasury bonds ten years ago on a net basis, and U.S. debt has not stopped growing,"" Gromen said. ""There's a widening gap between the supply of U.S. Treasury bonds and demand from global central banks.""
For Gromen's reason why this has been happening, watch the video above. 
Gold has been seeing solid gains this year, up 12.5% year-to-date, after hitting multiple new record highs, and it will keep rising towards 2030, Gromen noted. 
""Every single thing in macro is telling you it will keep going higher. You're seeing the BRICS go into gold. You're seeing Yellen throw 40 years of economic orthodoxy in the trash. You're seeing the Fed say we won't let Treasury market dysfunction happen by adding liquidity when it is needed,"" he said. 
The alternative to the Treasuries as the global reserve asset is gold. ""Treasuries for central banks are no longer risk-free instruments. If you do something the United States government doesn't like, they will take the Treasuries—full stop. They've done it to Russia and others, which has opened eyes,"" Gromen said.  
Gromen added that nobody trusts the Chinese yuan when it comes to finding another reserve option, and even if they did, China doesn't want to open its capital account and issue debt.
""Gold is doing what it's doing because gold is taking the place of Treasury bonds as a primary reserve asset globally at the central bank level. And as that happens, that's a lot of buying against a gold market whose annual production is $240 billion,"" he explained. 
Gold price forecast 
The markets are sensing this shift away from Treasuries, increasing gold prices. 
""Markets are reflexively beginning to understand that Treasury market dysfunction will not be allowed on a sustained basis, in which case you've got a 130 trillion dollar global bond market increasingly squeezing into the 65 trillion dollar U.S dollar equity market, roughly 14 trillion dollar gold market and the 1.4 trillion dollar Bitcoin market,"" Gromen said. 
This is why there have been spikes in S&P 500, Nasdaq, gold, and Bitcoin charts over the long bond. ""All of this has happened in the last 18 to 24 months. Those are the signs of the bond market recognizing that, on a real basis, it is the sucker at the card table. The bubble is in the long-term U.S. Treasury bonds,"" Gromen noted. 
To put gold's upcoming multi-year rally into perspective, Gromen said that gold's move higher has barely begun. ""To reflect a reversion to the mean of being the primary reserve asset, it needs to be orders of magnitude higher in price,"" he said. 
To get a more precise outlook, Gromen looks at the market value of U.S. official gold relative to foreign-held treasuries outstanding. 
""In 1989, when the USSR fell, that percentage was 20%. When we had a dollar crisis in 1979 and 1980, the percentage was 134%. Fast forward to today, this ratio is at 7%. So gold would need to triple just to get back to the very bottom of the long of this range where we were in 1989, the last time we had a great power competition,"" he estimated. 
This is Gromen's conservative outlook; for his other price scenarios, watch the video above. 
What it all means for Bitcoin
Bitcoin also plays a key role in this new reserve asset environment. 
""Bitcoin is an energy-linked neutral reserve asset for the people. It is a digital gold-like instrument in that way. More dollar liquidity means a weaker dollar, and that's good for Bitcoin,"" Gromen said. ""It does a lot of things that gold does arguably better than gold. But again, it has a lot more volatility, and it is a much smaller market.""
Gromen is not ruling out 6X returns for Bitcoin in the next six years as investors sell bonds and buy assets that hold value. ""Something that holds value is U.S. stocks, gold, and Bitcoin.""
In this scenario, Bitcoin would outperform gold due to higher volatility. ""If gold goes up 3X, I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin goes up 6X. They can both win,"" he said.

4,"Jun 14, 2024","Chinese physical gold demand slid across the board in May, but ETFs remained strong – World Gold Council","
(Kitco News) – Chinese physical gold demand was weaker across the board in May amid high local prices, but local ETFs continued their recent string of inflows, according to Ray Jia, China Research Head at the World Gold Council.
“Gold extended its strength in May albeit with a narrower increase than in recent months,” Jia wrote in the latest WGC China update. “Both the LBMA Gold Price AM in USD and the SHAUPM in RMB rose by 1% last month.”

Jia said that U.S. dollar weakness, lower bond yields, and rising demand from gold ETFs contributed to gold’s price strength during the month, but early June saw the LBMA Gold Price AM fall by 2% while the SHAUPM in RMB saw a further 1% rise due to a weakening yuan. 
“During the first five months of 2024, gold in RMB has surged by more than 15%, outperforming all major assets in China,” he noted. “Robust demand, geopolitical risk spikes, RMB weakness, and the prospect of a global easing cycle ahead, were the main drivers of gold’s strength.”

Physical demand for the yellow metal cooled significantly last month, posting its weakest May in four years.
“Gold withdrawals from the SGE amounted to 82t in May, 49t lower m/m and 30t lower y/y,” Jia said. “[T]he elevated gold price dimmed consumer interest in gold jewellery, leading to weaker-than-expected sales during the five-day International Labour Day Holiday in early May – a traditional demand boost – and this trend continued for the rest of the month.”
He added that the moderation in gold prices also discouraged physical bar and coin investors to the sidelines.
“Consequently, wholesale gold demand experienced its weakest May since 2020 – when demand was affected by the COVID pandemic – ending the month 34% below the 10-year average,” Jia said. “Nonetheless, due to demand strength earlier this year, gold withdrawals have totalled 736t so far in 2024, 35t higher y/y.”

Jia said that activity in China’s gold futures market also pulled back considerably in May. “Following the surge in April, trading volumes of Shanghai Futures Exchange’s active gold future contract cooled – averaging 193t per day in May, a 44% m/m fall,” he wrote. “However, volumes remain well above the five-year average of 163t.”

The premium local buyers paid over global spot prices also fell last month. “On average, the Chinese gold price premium fell to US$32/oz in May, US$10/oz lower m/m,” Jia said. The m/m drop was mainly driven by weakening wholesale demand.”

But despite all the other price and demand indicators sliding, the country’s gold ETFs still saw continued inflows in May.
“Chinese gold ETFs added RMB1.8bn (US$253mn) in May, the sixth consecutive monthly inflow,” Jia noted. “May pushed the total AUM to RMB48bn (US$6.7bn), another record high, and collective holdings increased by 3t to 87t, also the highest ever.”

Jia said that declining equities, yuan weakness, and a slide in Chinese government bond yields combined to push investors into gold.
“Interestingly, we noticed accelerating inflows towards the end of the month when the gold price corrected, showing signs of ‘dip buying’, which had been the main pattern prior to 2020,” he said. “Chinese funds have attracted RMB14bn (US$2bn) y-t-d, pushing total AUM and holdings 41% and 65% higher, respectively.”
Of course, the big news from last Friday was the announcement that the gold reserves of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) remained unchanged in May, bringing its 18-month buying streak to an end.
“The PBoC’s gold reserves stood at 2,264t at the end of May; the first month in which there has been no announcement of gold buying since November 2022,” Jia wrote. “Gold now accounts for 4.93% of China’s total official reserves, the highest ever thanks to May’s gold price strength. The PBOC stated gold reserve increase remains at 29t y-t-d, representing a 1.3% rise in holdings during the same period.”

Imports were also marginally lower in April, the WGC noted, with consumers electing to remain on the sidelines as local gold prices hovered close to record highs.
“Gold imports into China totalled 77t in April, 8t lower m/m and a 24t fall y/y,” Jia said. “We believe this was mainly a result of weaker gold jewellery demand during the month.”

“Nonetheless, imports held up relatively well during past months when the gold price surged – investment demand strength has partially cancelled out gold jewellery consumption slowdown,” he said.
Looking ahead, Jia said that high prices “may continue to suppress gold jewellery consumption and further divert consumers to lighter and cheaper products,” and added that they “don’t expect wholesale demand to pick up until mid-to-late Q3, when manufacturers and retailers replenish for the National Day Holiday sales boost.”
Regarding the pullback in bar and coin sales he said the WGC believes that “heightened geopolitical risks, as well as the fact that gold has been a strong-performing non-RMB and global asset, should continue to attract investors” but in the near term, “investment demand for gold may be negatively impacted by the recent price correction – which may push undecided investors to the sidelines.”"

Friday, the University of Michigan said the preliminary reading of its Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 65.6 compared to May’s revised reading of 69.1. The data was weaker than expected, as consensus forecasts called for a reading of around 72.1.
The gold market continues to see stick resistance at $2,350 an ounce in its initial reaction to the latest sentiment numbers. August gold futures last traded at $2,347 an ounce, up more than 1.25% on the day.
Although the data was weaker than expected, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu dismissed the decline saying sentiment is little changed from May.
“this month’s reading was a statistically insignificant 3.5 index points below May and within the margin of error. Sentiment is currently about 31% above the trough seen in June 2022 amid the escalation in inflation,” she said. “Overall, consumers perceive few changes in the economy from May.”
Although one-year inflation expectations were unchanged at 3.3%, the report noted broad-based expectations for inflation to remain stubbornly elevated for the foreseeable future.
Hsu noted that the one-year inflation expectations remain above the two-year range seen before the pandemic.
“Long-run inflation expectations have been remarkably stable over the last three years but remain elevated relative to the 2.2-2.6% range seen in the two years pre-pandemic,” she said.  "
6,"Jun 14, 2024",Good price gains for gold as U.S. bond yields dip  ,"(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are higher, with gold posting soild gains, in early U.S. trading Friday. A dip in U.S. Treasury yields late this week is friendly for the two precious metals markets. Gold and silver traders may be thinking about the old trading adage: “The bond market traders are the smartest guys/gals in the room.” If that’s actually the case, then it can be extrapolated that the late-week dip in U.S. Treasury yields suggests the bond traders believe the Federal Reserve will ease its monetary policy later this year, with at least one interest rate cut, if not two. This notion comes despite the more-hawkish-than-expected FOMC meeting this week. August gold was last up $30.20 at $2,348.00. July silver was last up $0.269 at $29.335.
Asian and European stock indexes were mixed overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward lower openings when the New York day session begins. It’s a quieter end Friday to what was a very busy trading week for the marketplace.
In overnight news, the Bank of Japan said it will reduce its government bond purchases in a signal of monetary policy tightening, but left its main interest rate unchanged. Still, the Japanese yen weakened against the U.S. dollar due to little specifics offered by the BOJ regarding future monetary policy moves.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index higher and hit a six-week high overnight. Nymex crude oil prices are near steady and trading around $78.75 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently 4.25%.
U.S. economic data due for release Friday includes import and export prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey.

Technically, August gold bulls and bears are on a level overall near-term technical playing field amid recent choppy trading. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at the June high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the June low of $2,304.20. First resistance is seen at this week’s high of $2,358.80 and then at $2,375.00. First support is seen at $2,330.00 and then at the overnight low of $2,316.70. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 5.0.

July silver futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage. However, prices are trending down on the daily bar chart. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at $31.00. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $28.00. First resistance is seen at Thursday’s high of $29.83 and then at $30.00. Next support is seen at $29.00 and then at this week’s low of $28.73. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0.

Although the PBOC didn’t announce any increase in its gold reserves last month, it had bought gold for 18 consecutive months, which was its longest shopping spree on record.Looking at Singapore’s gold reserves, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is the sixth biggest gold buyer so far this year. It is also the only developed market central bank to increase its gold reserves.In an interview with Kitco News, George Milling-Stanley, Chief Gold Strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said that he expects China to continue buying gold, even if its purchases will be less consistent than this past year and a half.
Milling-Stanley also said that he expects Asian demand to continue to play a dominant role in the gold market.“Investment demand in that part of the world, the Far East, the Middle East, India, subcontinent, and so on, has always had a major influence on the price, and the more it grows, the more influence it's going to have,” he said. “Population growth has been fastest through the emerging markets for the 50 years I've looked at gold. Economic growth has been fastest in the emerging markets all the time I've been looking at gold. Both of those factors will dictate who takes the most gold.”"
9,"Jun 13, 2024","State Street’s Milling-Stanley upgrades gold forecast, sees prices trading between $2,200 and $2,500 in H2 2024","(Kitco News) - The gold market has seen elevated volatility in recent weeks amid dynamic shifts in interest rate expectations; however, one market strategist said that the precious metal remains well supported even as the Federal Reserve hesitates to cut interest rates anytime soon.In an interview with Kitco News, George Milling-Stanley, Chief Gold Strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said that gold remains an attractive asset as the world remains rife with uncertainty. While the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to embark on an easing cycle could limit gold’s gains in the near term, Milling-Stanley said he doesn’t see this as a significant headwind.Milling-Stanley said that although the Fed is not ready to cut rates now, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear Wednesday that the central bank is not looking to raise interest rates again.“The pressure, I think, should remain on the U.S. dollar even if we’re only going to get one rate hike this year,” he said. “Ultimately, we are still in line for a period of Fed easing once we get a slowdown in the economy.”In the current climate, Milling-Stanley and his team at State Street are increasing their base-case price range for gold through the second half of the year. Milling-Stanley said that they now see gold prices trading between $2,200 and $2,500 an ounce.The firm’s new price range is up significantly from its initial base case range between $1,900 and $2,200 an ounce. At the start of the year, Milling-Stanley also ascribed a 30% chance to gold pushing above $2,400 an ounce.Milling-Stanley said that his gold price upgrade reflects heightened uncertainty worldwide.“People are nervous about what’s still going on in Ukraine, people are nervous over what will happen with China over Taiwan, people are nervous about all the elections, and they are nervous about the economy,” he said. “Are consumers prepared for the Federal Reserve’s expected slowdown? Hell no, and that is a scary thought. We are surrounded by uncertainty and what asset does well during uncertain times?”Although Milling-Stanley is bullish on gold through the rest of the year, he added that he doesn’t rule out prices remaining volatile. However, he pointed out that this is the natural function of the market as investors take profits.“Given the rally, investors have had very, very big profits to take,” he said.Milling-Stanley said that what will ultimately propel gold higher is the realization that U.S. monetary policy isn’t supportive of a strong dollar and will be even less supportive as the economy weakens.“There is always a danger that the Fed will do what it has done so often in the past, which is to adopt the right course and then stick to that course for too long so that it becomes the wrong course,” he said.  “People will soon start to realize that the pressure is not on gold right now; the pressure is really on the dollar.”"
10,"Jun 13, 2024",Four central banks sign new framework to enable responsible gold sourcing from small-scale miners in domestic currency,"
(Kitco News) – The World Gold Council (WGC) announced on Wednesday that four central banks have committed to signing ‘The London Principles’, a set of operating guidelines for responsibly sourcing gold from small-scale domestic miners.
The London Principles are a set of operating principles to help structure and formalize Central Bank Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Domestic Purchase Programmes (ASGM DPP), and the four inaugural signatories are the central banks of Colombia, Ecuador, Mongolia, and the Philippines. The WGC said in the announcement that the commitment of these institutions “represents progress towards more responsible gold sourcing practices worldwide.”
“The World Gold Council is committed to improving transparency, trust and integrity across the entire value chain,” said David Tait, chief executive officer of the World Gold Council. “By using the market power and visibility of central banks, who are often the largest or even sole legal buyer of ASGM production in their countries, we hope to instill responsible gold sourcing practices in countries where ASGM is prevalent.”
Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an important source of livelihood for ordinary people in many gold-producing countries, with some estimates suggesting that 15 million people around the world make their living from ASGM. “However, [ASGM] is often unfortunately associated with illicit activities, lack of environmental protection, labour abuses, and other harmful practices,” the WGC said. “ASGM DPPs offer a route to help bring responsible artisanal and small-scale gold miners into the formal supply chain.”
In recent years, some central banks have launched programs to buy gold produced by domestic artisanal and small-scale gold miners in local currency. “The schemes are mutually beneficial as small-scale miners can sell their production to a trustworthy source that offers transparent buying processes and pricing,” the WGC noted. “In addition, central banks can add gold to their official reserves using their local currency, allowing them to grow their reserve assets without having to sacrifice other hard currency reserves.”
As gold is priced and sold in U.S. dollars internationally, the ability for countries to purchase domestic gold in their own currency can be a significant advantage over acquiring bullion through the global gold markets.
“Over the last two years we have worked with central banks who operate ASGM DPPs to exchange best practices and learn from experts,” said Head of Asia-Pacific (ex-China) & Global Head of Central Banks Shaokai Fan at the World Gold Council. “We are pleased to see the group evolve into ‘The signatories of The London Principles’, a trusted circle of central banks who adhere to the most stringent requirements for ASGM DPPs.”
“The participants in this initiative believe that well-structured ASGM DPPs have the potential to contribute to sustainable development, support formalisation and raise ESG standards,” Fan added.
Tait called it “a critical moment for artisanal and small-scale gold miners,” and said the WGC envisions that the original signatory banks “will provide a blueprint for others that are considering how to help formalise domestic ASGM to the benefit of their economies and the people who earn a livelihood from this industry.”
The 12 London Principles encompass commitments to: Legal frameworks, resourcing and transparency; Community well-being; Mercury reduction; Due diligence; Progressive improvement; Formalization; Incentives; Rule of law; Accessibility; Access to ‘clean’ finance; Refining purchased gold; and International cooperation."
11,"Jun 13, 2024","Gold, silver see strong losses as USDX rallies amid hawkish Fed","(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are sharply lower and near daily lows in midday U.S. trading Thursday. A rally in the U.S. dollar index and a hawkish Federal Reserve are trumping tame U.S. inflation reports late this week. August gold was last down $39.70 at $2,315.40. July silver hit a five-week low and was last down $1.322 at $28.945.
Technical selling was also featured in gold and silver markets today as the near-term chart postures for both metals have turned more bearish recently.
Today’s U.S. producer price index report for May came in at down 0.2%, month-on-month, versus market expectations for up 0.1% and compares to the April report’s rise of 0.5%. The core PPI in May (minus food and energy) came in at unchanged versus up 0.3% expected, month-on-month, and compares to a rise of 0.5% in the April report. The tame PPI report today followed a tamer consumer price index report on Wednesday.
However, the Federal Reserve Wednesday delivered a surprisingly hawkish outlook. The FOMC members revised U.S. rate-cut expectations to one cut from three cuts that were expected in March. Updated Fed projections also included upward revisions to U.S. inflation in 2024 and 2025 to 2.6% (2.4% in March) and 2.3% (2.2% in March), respectively. The Fed did hold its monetary policy steady at this week’s meeting. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at his press conference said the latest inflation numbers lower than expected but may not have been fully reflecting the latest quarterly Fed projections. The hawkish Fed has helped to boost the U.S. dollar index late this week. However, U.S. Treasury yields Thursday did dip just a bit, suggesting bond traders think the Fed will still cut interest rates later this year.
The other key outside market today sees Nymex crude oil prices near steady and trading around $78.50 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently around 4.25%.

Technically, August gold bulls have quickly lost their slight overall near-term technical advantage. A bear flag or bearish pennant pattern has formed on the daily bar chart. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at last week’s high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at $2,250.00.

12,"Jun 13, 2024","Saudi Arabia ends petrodollar agreement: What it means for the USD, Bitcoin, and gold","(Kitco News) – The established financial world order of the past 50 years is now transitioning to a new and unknown paradigm as the petrodollar agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia was allowed to expire this past Sunday. 
 
The term ‘petrodollar’ described the U.S. dollar’s (USD) role as the currency used for crude oil transactions on the world market. It traces back to the early 1970s when the United States and Saudi Arabia struck a deal shortly after the U.S. went off the gold standard – and the agreement has had far-reaching consequences for the global economy.
 
The petrodollar agreement came about following the 1973 oil crisis. It stipulated that Saudi Arabia would price its oil exports exclusively in U.S. dollars and invest its surplus oil revenues in U.S. Treasury bonds. In exchange, the U.S. provided military support and protection to the kingdom. 
 
This helped the USD cement its position as the world’s reserve currency and ushered in an era of prosperity for Americans as they enjoyed the benefits of being the preferred market for global corporations to sell their wares. Additionally, the inflow of foreign capital into U.S. Treasury bonds has supported low interest rates and a robust bond market.
 
All that is set to change now as Saudi Arabia is looking to move beyond an exclusive relationship with the U.S. – as evidenced by the kingdom becoming one of the newest members of the BRICS bloc. 
 
While many point to escalating global tensions and shifting geopolitical allegiances as the impetus for allowing the agreement to expire, changes in the power dynamics of the global oil market have also played a crucial role in this development as the world moves towards alternative energy sources. 
 
The rise of renewables and natural gas has been steadily reducing the world’s reliance on oil for the past decade, and even oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia have evolved. 
 
The Kingdom is on track to generate half its electricity with renewables and natural gas by 2030 and plans to plant 10 billion trees as part of a larger goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2060. To achieve this, they have implemented more than 80 public and private sector initiatives representing an investment of over $188 billion. 
 
Their decision to go in that direction has also been influenced by the emergence of new oil-producing nations, such as Brazil and Canada, which have challenged the traditional dominance of the Middle East.
 
While many analysts have said that the threat to the USD’s status as the reserve currency is overblown, most acknowledge that the expiration of the petrodollar agreement has the long-term potential to weaken the USD and, by extension, U.S. financial markets. 
 
At present, the Kingdom is still accepting U.S. dollars in exchange for oil, but some of the world’s largest economies are attempting to change that, notably China. For years, China has been actively trying to get Saudi Arabia to accept the yuan for oil purchases, and while the Kingdom has thus far refrained from making the switch, they have expressed openness to the idea. 
 
According to digital news service Sputnik, “Nearly 80 percent of global oil sales are priced in dollars. However, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, and others are increasingly shifting to local currencies in energy trade. In 2023, 20 percent of global oil was bought in other currencies, as per the Wall Street Journal.”
 

The Kingdom’s acceptance into the BRICS bloc has the potential to influence this decision. If Saudi Arabia moves to expand beyond the USD, it would materially weaken the currency’s dominance in the oil market – and as a result, its place on the world stage. A decline in global demand for the greenback could result in higher inflation, higher interest rates, and a weaker bond market in the United States.
 
Sputnik said, “If world players significantly reduce the use of US dollars, the US' ability to issue dollar debt and earn dollars for exports will diminish and the nation's economy will shrink, according to international economists.” 
 
The primary reasons for not making the switch at this point are the stability and the global acceptance of the U.S. dollar. While the USD-for-oil status quo remains in effect for the time being, the expiration of the petrodollar agreement represents a significant shift in global power dynamics and highlights the changing energy landscape and the growing influence of emerging economies.
 
Evidence that the U.S. understands the importance of maintaining a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia can be found in reports that the Biden administration is close to finalizing a treaty with the Kingdom that would commit the U.S. to help defend them as part of a deal aimed at encouraging diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel. 
 
As reported by Reuters, “The possible deal, widely telegraphed by U.S. and other officials for weeks, is part of a wider package that would include a U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear pact, steps toward the establishment of a Palestinian state and an end to the war in Gaza, where months of ceasefire efforts have failed to bring peace.”
 
The treaty, known as the Strategic Alliance Agreement, would require a two-thirds majority vote in the U.S. Senate to be approved. According to U.S. and Saudi officials, the draft treaty is modeled loosely on Washington's mutual security pact with Japan.
 
In exchange for the U.S. commitment to defend Saudi Arabia in an attack, the draft treaty would grant Washington access to Saudi territory and airspace to protect U.S. interests and regional partners, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
 
Effect on USD, Bitcoin and gold
 
“The end of the US-Saudi petrodollar agreement would likely have a minimal effect on the USD,” said Daniel Krupka, Head of Research at Coin Bureau, in a note to Kitco Crypto. “This is because Saudi Arabia would likely convert the non-USD currencies it's receiving for oil payments into the USD anyways.”
 
“Although a BRICS currency may have some level of adoption, it would not be able to achieve the level of adoption similar to that of the USD, gold, or Bitcoin without being backed by a stable economy,” he added. “Neither party benefits from the end of the agreement in the short term as it effectively just complicates things. In the long term, it could make Saudi Arabia less reliant on the USD depending on what the country does with its non-USD proceeds.”
 
Touching on the draft defense treaty, Krupka said it “may maintain the bilateral relationship at the strategic level, but it does not directly replace the economic aspect of the petrodollar deal.”
 
He also noted that the “Saudi Riyal is pegged to the USD,” which means that “Saudi Arabia needs USD to support its currency.”
 
“However, the end of the agreement could be bad for the USD insofar as Saudi Arabia decides to convert these non-USD currency proceeds into other assets, such as gold or BTC,” Krupka suggested. “More diversification of Saudi assets into gold or Bitcoin could help push up prices, although this is contingent on the extent of diversification.”
 

""The symbolism of the end of the US-Saudi petrodollar agreement marks a shift toward a future that is further economically and geopolitically fragmented,” said Brian Mahoney, co-founder of Acre, in a note shared with Kitco Crypto. “It means that the world’s currency for top energy assets like oil is no longer priced just in dollars, opening the door to alternative assets instead.”
 
“Bitcoin would make sense as an asset to be explored for adoption going forward given its ties to energy companies (through its proof of work consensus mechanism) and the fact that it is the top digitally native asset by market cap in an increasingly digital global economy,” he added.
 
While the details on the future of a BRICS currency are scant, Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday, “Within BRICS, we’re working on shaping an independent payment system, free from political pressure, abuse and external sanctional interference.”
 
Some have suggested that a BRICS currency could be backed by a basket of commodities, of which gold would be a part – which would likely benefit gold prices. 
 
Most analysts hold the position that it will be years before the USD loses its reserve currency status, but X user Bullion Buzz highlighted the ongoing ramp-up in the transition away from Western currencies amid the rise in geopolitical tensions. 
Jaime Carrasco, Senior Investment Advisor and Senior Portfolio Manager at Canaccord Genuity Financial said “What is important to every Western investor is the fact that the #Petrodollar is being replaced in #oil sales with the #gold convertible #Petroyuan contract, and I'm sure Saudi Arabia the UAE and Iran, like Russia, will be glad to accept #gold in trade settlement for their oil instead of USD.”
 
In response to a post from Gold Telegraph highlighting that “Gold has overtaken the euro in global international reserves,” Carrasco said, “Great infographics which begs one question, at what price will it be when it overtakes the mighty USD?”
 
He also noted that “Saudi Arabia has announced that they will be joining Bank of International Settlements’s mBridge payment system and thus leaving the Petrodollar system as the only payment system for energy.” 
 
And X user Doctor Profit said the end of the agreement would lead to more debt printing in the U.S., ultimately leading to increased inflation. 
“It’s more a long-term rise,” he added. “Affects from this change will be seen in 8-12 months from today. Outcome is rising inflation and higher prices for everything, including stocks, BTC, real estate, and gold.”"

Carleton spoke to Kitco Mining in early June at THE Mining Investment Event of the North in Quebec City.

The CSE has offices in Vancouver and Toronto. It has over 800 listings.
Gold has hit several all-time highs in 2024, but resource companies are not seeing much of a lift, noted Carleton.
""The index of gold exploration companies, even the later stage companies that have extended their projects to quite a considerable degree...still haven't gotten the love from the markets in terms of the valuations at this point,"" said Carleton.
In the spring, the Canadian federal government proposed a rise in the capital gains tax. Starting June 25, the capital gains inclusion rate would be increased from one-half to two-thirds for capital gains of over $250,000 per year for Canadians, and on all capital gains for corporations and most types of trusts, according to a statement by the Canadian finance ministry.
Carleton said the proposed changes will have “a devastating impact on flow-through financing and other means of direct investment into exploration and mining” in Canada.

14,"Jun 13, 2024","Gold, silver modestly pare price losses after tame U.S. PPI   ","(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are solidly lower but up from daily lows in early U.S. trading Thursday, following another tame U.S. inflation report. August gold was last down $21.00 at $2,333.40. July silver hit a five-week low overnight and was last down $0.827 at $29.45.
(Just a note to remind that Comex gold and silver futures markets’ official closes and daily settlements occur just after midday. Thus, on busy afternoons in the markets, such as Wednesday, the following day’s differences in daily price changes between futures and spot can be large, due to gold and silver futures prices settling at midday—before important news developments such as Wednesday’s FOMC meeting conclusion.)
Today’s U.S. producer price index report for May came in at down 0.2%, month-on-month, versus market expectations for up 0.1% and compares to the April report’s rise of 0.5%. The core PPI in May (minus food and energy) came in at unchanged versus up 0.3% expected, month-on-month, and compares to a rise of 0.5% in the April report.
Traders and investors today are still digesting a busy and important trading day Wednesday that saw a tame U.S. consumer price index report but more-hawkish-than-expected Federal Reserve FOMC meeting results. The precious metals, stock and U.S. Treasury markets bulls were humming along quite well in the aftermath of the cooler CPI print Wednesday morning. And then the Fed delivered a surprisingly hawkish outlook early Wednesday afternoon. The FOMC members revised U.S. rate-cut expectations to one cut from three cuts that were expected in March. Updated Fed projections also included upward revisions to U.S. inflation in 2024 and 2025 to 2.6% (2.4% in March) and 2.3% (2.2% in March), respectively. The Fed did hold its monetary policy steady at this week’s meeting. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at his press conference said the latest inflation numbers lower than expected but may not have been fully reflecting the latest quarterly Fed projections. The precious metals, the U.S. stock index and U.S. Treasury markets all lost some steam after the Fed statement and Powell presser.
Still, a Barron’s headline today reads: “Markets remain confident of cuts despite Fed.” The story said “traders seem to think they know more than the Federal Reserve about where interest rates are going.” Indeed, that’s a fair criticism as the past couple years have seen the Fed behind the curve on actual U.S. economic developments, and the U.S. central bank could now be behind the curve on problematic inflation actually being tamped down. Today’s cooler PPI report falls in line with that notion.

15,"Jun 13, 2024","Gold prices remain under pressure, ignoring 0.2% drop in US PPI","(Kitco News) - The gold market continues to see solid selling pressure even as producers saw weak price pressure last month.
The Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 0.2% in May, following April’s 0.5% increase, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The latest inflation data was significantly cooler than expected, as economists looked for a 0.1% increase.
In the last 12 months headline wholesale inflation increased 2.2%, the report said. 
At the same time, core PPI, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, was unchanged last month. Economists were forecasting a 0.3% increase. Annual core PPI increased 2.3%.
The gold market is off its lows but continues to see solid technical selling pressure after it was unable to hold support at $2,350 an ounce. August gold futures last traded at $2,380 an ounce, down 0.71% on the day. 
However, some market analysts have said that falling producer prices could give the Federal Reserve confidence to ease interest rates as early as September, supporting gold’s long-term uptrend.
“Fed funds futures are back to fully pricing in two cuts this year,” said Adam Button, Head of Currency Strategy at Forexlive.com
PPI is seen as a leading inflation indicator as producers pass on higher costs to their customers. "

17,"Jun 12, 2024",A peak in global rates is good for gold BoC and ECB can continue to lower interest rates without the Fed,"(Kitco News) - Although the Federal Reserve could still lower interest rates one or two times this year, it continues to signal that it is not in a hurry to adjust its monetary policy just yet.
However, analysts note that despite the U.S.’s reluctance to ease interest rates, the gold market remains well supported as global rates start to fall. The diverging monetary policies in the global marketplace are being driven by the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank, both of which have cut interest rates due to easing inflation pressures in their respective economies.
Analysts have said that while the Federal Reserve remains the most significant driver for gold, the fact that global rates have peaked should provide some support for the precious metal. Despite the Federal Reserve’s stance to hold rates at restrictive levels, gold has held critical support at $2,300 an ounce.
According to the latest comments from the Bank of Canada and Germany’s Bundesbank, a member of the ECB, investors can expect to see further divergence in global monetary policies that could support gold prices.
Speaking at the 30th annual Conference of Montreal by the International Economic Forum of the Americas, BoC Governor Tiff Macklem provided the most explicit monetary policy outlook.
“If the economy evolves broadly in line with our own forecast, if inflation continues to ease, it is reasonable to expect further interest rate cuts,” he said.
However, Macklem added that while interest rates have room to move lower, they will still be higher than they were before the pandemic.
“Global interest rates are probably not returning to pre-pandemic levels. The new normal won't be the old normal. And if we're not going back, well, we all have to adjust,” he said.
Bundesbank President Dr. Joachim Nagel was less explicit in his monetary outlook. He reiterated the ECB’s stance that it remains data-dependent and that decisions will be made meeting by meeting.
However, he provided markets with some optimism that the central bank expects inflation to be under control.
“In this uncertain world, we have to be very cautious, not showing any complacency in our mandate to fight against inflation,” he said. “I have once described inflation as a greedy beast. We are in a situation where we have tamed this greedy beast, but our task is not done.”
Although the ECB has tempered further rate cut expectations, markets are pricing in two rate cuts this year. In Canada, markets are expecting to see three rate cuts by year-end.
Talking about the divergence in global interest rates, Macklem said that so far, the market has been able to absorb this difference. While there is a limit to how much the Bank of Canada can do without the Federal Reserve, Macklem said they are not there yet.
Nagel said that given the different inflationary environments, it makes sense for the ECB to cut rates before the Federal Reserve, something that has never happened before. "
18,"Jun 12, 2024","Fed may cut later than ECB, BoC, but cut they shall, and gold will soar – David Rosenberg","
(Kitco News) – The Fed may be late to the party but once they begin cutting, history says gold will take off, according to David Rosenberg, founder and president at Rosenberg Research.
In a recent interview with BNN Bloomberg, Rosenberg was asked about the interest rate divergence between the Federal Reserve and other developed economies after both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada cut rates last week, and whether he expects those banks to continue cutting.
“The Fed has already told you that it's a waiting game for them,” Rosenberg said. “I've been doing this for 40 years. Whenever any central bank… look at [ECB President] Christine Lagarde last week. Whenever they start to cut rates they never want the markets to leapfrog them, to front-run them, so they're always cautious at the first rate cut.”
Rosenberg said that he expects things to play out the same way when the United States begins their own rate-cutting cycle. “You're going to see when the Fed cuts rates later this year I think that they will start in September,” he said. “Powell's going to actually sound pretty hawkish or cautious, that's just the way things go in central banking.”
Rosenberg said that markets aren’t yet accounting for the number of cuts that are to come. “What's happening is that there is not enough Bank of Canada easing priced in, and as these interest rate differentials widen against the Canadian dollar – and there's nothing more important for any currency than relative interest rate differentials, by the way, and that includes the Canadian dollar which is also commodity based – the Loonie’s going to go down.”
He added that he sees a weaker CAD as a positive development. “It should go down,” Rosenberg said. “We need the weaker Canadian dollar. The economy needs that sort of stimulus right now.”
Rosenberg was then asked whether he still likes gold as an investment, following its dramatic rally and the sudden pullback after China’s central bank announced a pause in purchases. 
“Remember, it's Rosenberg, not Goldberg, just to set the record straight,” he joked before adding, “you can look at the moving averages and sentiment and trade around gold, [but] for us, for years it's been buy and hold, a diversifier in the portfolio.”
“But we are going into a global interest rate cut cycle,” he emphasized. “It doesn't matter if the Fed’s the last man standing, the Fed will be cutting rates, and the U.S. dollar might not weaken initially, but next year when the Fed plays catch-up to everybody else, the U.S. dollar will be weakening.”
Rosenberg said that another thing he liked about the yellow metal’s recent rally is that it hasn’t been limited to the greenback.  
“What I liked about gold, in particular in this rally to the highs, is that it was making a high in every currency, not just the U.S. dollar, which is telling you something, that this is a real, bona fide bull market in bullion,” he said. “You just have to look at the history books, and look at the relationship, that when you go into a global interest rate cutting cycle, which we are in the early stages, gold does very well in that environment.”"
19,"Jun 12, 2024","Gold prices trying to hold the line at $2,350 as Federal Reserve leaves rates unchanged signals one rate cuts this year","(Kitco News) - The gold market is struggling to hold the line at $2,350 an ounce as the Federal Reserve continues to pare down its interest rate cut expectations.
As expected, the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged within a range of 5.25% to 5.50%.
The updated economic projections show the central bank sees one rate cut this year, down from three estimated in March. The Federal Reserve's interest rate estimate, also known as the dot plot, shows the Fed funds rate ending the year above 5.00%.
While holding positive gains, the gold market has fallen slightly below $2,350 an ounce, which has proven to be a critical resistance point. August gold futures last traded at $2,345.80 an ounce, up 0.79% on the day.
According to some economists, the U.S. central bank continues to keep its options open as inflation remains stubbornly elevated. However, the central bank did tweet its comment on inflation.
“Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective,” the central bank said in its monetary policy statement.
Looking at the economic projections, the central bank kept its GDP forecast unchanged at 2.1% growth for this year and 2.0% growth in 2025 and 2026.
The Federal Reserve also expects the U.S. labor market to remain healthy, with the unemployment rate rising this year to 4.0%, unchanged from the March forecast. It is expected to rise to 4.2% next year and 4.1% in 2026, up from 4.1% and 4.0%, respectively, in the previous estimate.
Looking at inflation, the central bank still doesn’t expect core PCE inflation to hit the 2% target until 2026. Core inflation is expected to rise to 2.8% this year, up from 2.6% projected in March. Inflation is expected to rise to 2.3% next year, up from the prior forecast of 2.2%.
Headline inflation is also expected to be higher this year and next before cooling in 2026. The central bank sees inflation rising to 2.6% this year, up from the previous estimate of 2.4%. Inflation is expected to rise to 2.3% next year, up from 2.2% projected in March.
Although the Fed has signaled only one rate cut this year, some economists note that it is a close call as eight out of 19 central banks still see two rate cuts. Ashworth, Chief North America Economist at Capital Economics, said that everything depends on the health of the economy.
“Overall, there’s nothing here that rules out a September rate cut. It all depends on the incoming data. If employment growth edges down again and the May price data prove to be the start of a renewed disinflationary trend, as we expect, then two rate cuts this year are still the most likely outcome,” he said."
20,"Jun 12, 2024",Geopolitical uncertainty is impacting the global economy and driving gold demand,"
(Kitco News) - Geopolitical uncertainty, which has fueled the de-dollarization trend and fragmentation in the global economy, has been a significant factor in gold’s unprecedented run to record highs above $2,450 this year.
According to industry and government experts at the 30th annual Conference of Montreal by the International Economic Forum of the Americas, this trend remains firmly in place, which should continue to support the precious metal’s uptrend.
The deglobalization trend has been a key theme in many of the panel discussions organized during the three-day conference.
“It’s extraordinary to me to see how rapidly we've moved from a situation where globalization seemed inevitable to where today it increasingly seems impossible,” said Perrin Beatty, a former Progressive Conservative Cabinet Minister and President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
Beatty narrated a discussion on the rise of economic nationalism, with the panelists noting that broad international trade agreements are being replaced with narrower agreements.
The panelists noted that the evolving trend of economic nationalism is increasing costs for businesses around the world, contributing to elevated inflation pressures.
“We are all disadvantaged by this trend. Every businessperson in the room knows how much more expensive it is, and it's only going to get more expensive,” said Jeff Nankivell, President and CEO of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada.
However, Nankivell noted that Canada’s pursuit of individual agreements is better than having no agreements.
“We have all these different trade agreements, but they all have different conditions attached to them. Many of them have side agreements that are trading rules you have to follow if you're going to benefit from the agreement. It’s really far from optimal, but we have to do our best,” Nankivell said.
Ali Borhani, Managing Director of 3Sixty Strategic Advisors Ltd and co-founder and host of the BRI Dialogues, discussed the role of Canada and Europe in the global economy as the two are stuck between the American Eagle and the Chinese Dragon. He said that it is important to recognize that the world is changing and to acknowledge the reasons for this change. He explained that there is a collective feeling of disillusion among the Global South towards developed nations in the Northern Hemisphere.
He pointed out that the expansion of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) is an indication that a new multi-polar world has been established.
“Half of the world population is in BRICS+. Two-thirds of world trade happens in BRICS+. BRICS are adding 74 million consumers a year. That is two times Canada out of these markets,” Borhani said. “The largest buyers of energy and the largest sellers of energy happen to be in the Global South and among BRICS. So we're looking at the rewiring of energy, finance, supply chain, and tech.”
He said that developing nations in the South are seeing growing double standards as richer nations impose their rules and agendas, such as the green energy transition. He added that the U.S. weaponization of the dollar against Russia for its war against Ukraine is also seen as a threat.
“The Global South is confused because the Global South hears, ‘everything net-zero, don't drill,’ and the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund now is digging at the bottom of the ocean. But no more oil for you in the Global South,” he said.
As emerging markets have become more disappointed with Western policies, China has been able to grow its influence. Borhani used a famous quote from Larry Summers, the US Secretary of the Treasury, to highlight this shift in influence in the developing world. “Every time you guys come here, Europeans and Americans, you give us a lecture. Every time the Chinese come, they give us an airport, a hospital,” he said.
Carlos Díaz-Rosillo, Founding Director of the Adam Smith Center for Economic Freedom at Florida International University, agreed with Borhani in the discussion, noting that Western nations have never shown up to help build the needed infrastructure in emerging markets.
“The United States has gone around the world, telling countries to choose. And I think one of the biggest failures of American foreign policy, and this is a bipartisan failure, is not providing an alternative [to China],” Díaz-Rosillo said. “We have to have a restructuring of foreign policy so that we work hand in hand with the private sector, so that those services and those projects that are badly needed have an American presence, have a European presence. We make the choice much easier for these countries to choose, to choose America, to choose Europe instead of China.”
However, it is not just the growing divide between developed nations and emerging market countries. Bernard Spitz, CEO and Founder of BS CONSEIL, said that there is significant fragmentation in Europe.
“We have had the [European] election just two days ago and we can see that Europeans are not aligned. So when we are talking about trade issues, if we are not aligned, it means that we are on a dangerous path,” he said. “If you have the addition of the French vision, the German vision, the Italian vision, etc., it's not a European policy. It's chaos.”
Climate change adds to economic uncertainty
Although some emerging markets have felt targeted by the West’s focus on the green energy transition, many executives at the conference said climate change is a threat that must be addressed.
In a discussion about the costs of decarbonization, panelists noted that emissions don’t acknowledge any borders and that emerging market economies are experiencing the greatest impact of climate change as volatile weather wreaks havoc, from destructive storms to devastating droughts worldwide.
An annual global investment of $5 trillion in energy transition technologies is necessary to combat the effects of climate change, the panelists said.
“Right now, it costs about $3 trillion to $6 trillion because we've delayed, really, for now about seven, eight years,” said Margaret Franklin, President and CEO of CFA Institute. “It's going to cost more every year that we don't invest and we don't address it.”
Franklin added that despite the high price tag, a cost-benefit analysis shows a break-even point on the investment.
“It's estimated by 2050, the impact of climate change on infrastructure, agriculture, healthcare, you name it, will cost us $38 trillion per annum,” she said.
Nicolás Albertoni, Uruguay’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, suggested that addressing climate change is a way to combat economic nationalism.
“If we want to be part of this global value chain, we have to be sustainable. We have to be the country in Latin America that is not just promoting a port, a platform, but also a sustainable perspective of development,” he said.
Solutions to address the growing geopolitical divide
Paul Slaby, Managing Director of Canada’s Semiconductor Council, suggested that technology could help promote a new type of globalism as economies rely heavily on microchips.
Slaby said that it will be impossible for one nation to control the global chip supply chain, but that there are opportunities for nations like Canada to build a niche integral space within the supply chain.
John Gallagher, Managing Director at Cerberus Capital Management’s Supply Chain and Strategic Opportunities team, told the conference that a strong supply of critical metals in North America could help establish stability in the global economy, reducing China’s influence in the marketplace.
Cerberus Capital Management is currently investing $50 million in Torngat Metals, which is developing its Strange Lake Rare Earth Project in Nunavik in Northern Quebec. Strange Lake is considered the largest critical metals deposit outside of China.
“A secure and resilient supply chain is nothing short of the center of gravity of modern national and economic security,” he said."
21,"Jun 12, 2024","Gold, silver post sharp gains on tame U.S. CPI; FOMC on deck","(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are solidly higher in midday U.S. trading Wednesday, following a U.S. inflation report that came in tame and in turn sunk the U.S. dollar index and U.S. Treasury yields. Now, precious metals trades are bracing for this afternoon’s FOMC meeting conclusion. August gold was last up $25.00 at $2,351.80. July silver was last up $0.974 at $30.21.
The U.S. consumer price index report for May, out Wednesday morning, came in at unchanged, month-on-month and up 3.3%, year-on-year. Monthly CPI was seen up 0.1% and up 3.4%, annually. The core CPI (excluding food and energy) for May was up 0.2%, month-on-month and up 3.4%, annually. Both core numbers were also slightly lower than expected. This CPI report falls into the camp of the U.S. monetary policy doves, who want to see the Federal Reserve cut interest rates sooner rather than later.  
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently at 4.256%--well down from the 4.40 reading just before the CPI print.
Precious metals traders are reckoning the tamer CPI will indeed allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates later this year. And if the Fed starts to ease its monetary policy, the other major central banks of the world are likely to follow. The European Central Bank last week began what could be a process of major central banks easing their money policies over the coming months, or longer. Easier monetary policies suggest more upbeat consumer spending attitudes amid lower borrowing costs. That scenario would mean better global demand for raw commodities, including the metals.
Traders and investors await the results of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of the Federal Reserve that ends Wednesday afternoon with a statement and press conference from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. No changes in U.S. monetary policy are expected at this week’s meeting but as always the rhetoric coming from the Fed will be parsed by the marketplace. Don’t be surprised to see the FOMC and Powell take today’s tamer CPI data as an opportunity to lean less hawkish on U.S. money policy. It could also be that today’s CPI report will usurp the FOMC statement and Powell press conference, regarding market significance.
The other key outside market today sees Nymex crude oil prices a bit higher and trading around $78.25 a barrel.

Technically, August gold bulls have gained the slight overall near-term technical advantage. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at last week’s high of $2,406.70.

22,"Jun 12, 2024","U.S. dollar remains unchallenged, but small changes in reserves have major impact on gold price – HSBC’s Steel","
(Kitco News) – The U.S. dollar’s place as the world’s reserve currency won’t be threatened for decades, but even minor changes to central banks’ reserves have a massive impact on the gold market, according to HSBC Securities Chief Commodities Analyst James Steel.
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Steel was asked about the issue of de-dollarization.
“That's been ascribed to some of the reasons that central banks, not just China, have been buying gold,” Steel said. “We don't believe that there's going to be any loss of sovereignty for the U.S. dollar as far as the world's reserve currency goes, for the next 10, 20 years, as far as we can see, for reasons that would take an entire program, you and I could talk about it.”
But Steel made a point of saying that even a small change in central banks’ reserve allocations would have major implications for commodities like precious metals.
“That's not to say that every single central bank in the world wants as many dollars as they do have,” he said. “They may want to reduce their reserves by, say, 65% to 62%. So what do you do with that 3%? Well, they're very limited as to what they can buy, both in fixed income and for currencies, and there may be a reason that they wouldn't want to buy the euro or the yen.”
“Gold provides a perfect sweet spot of getting out of the dollar without going into something else,” he said.
Steel was then asked what trade people most want to talk to him about these days. “Well, trying to figure out gold,” he said.
“I’ve just come back from Europe, and both in Europe and North America, the previous [gold] rallies have had a clear smoking gun,” Steel said. “This one hasn't so much. And that's what makes it so interesting.”
Steel said that the most recent rally has been driven by multiple factors. “There's geopolitics going on as well,” he said. “You can come to me and you can say, ‘Jim, what happens to gold?’ Usually when the Fed cuts by 50 basis points or when it increases, or when the dollar goes up this much or down this much…”
“But Gaza is different from Ukraine,” he said. “It's different from the South China Sea, it’s different from the Taiwan Straits. So every geopolitical event may have a different impact on gold.”
Steel was also asked about the difference in retail prices for gold jewelry in stores like Tiffany’s compared to the metal itself.
“It's very, very high, it’s hundreds of percent,” he said. “Hundreds of percent, but you're paying for the artistry and you're paying for the workmanship. It's well worth it. It hasn't dimmed the demand at the high end.”
“It's one of the reasons the [U.S. jewelry] gold price doesn't change,” he added, “whereas in Asia, you'll see that the markup is very low and the prices change rapidly in the shops.”
Back in April, Steel warned that the piling in of momentum traders into the gold market had increased the odds of sudden and sharp slides in price.
“I think you have to look at the genesis of the [rally],” Steel said at the time. “In addition to geopolitical risks, which are significant, we've also had a lot of extraneous players coming into the market in the past several months, who I think are not so much interested in the price of gold as such, but they wish to hedge their equity exposure. There's a lot of debate in the equity markets about how high equities can go, and many managers, fund managers, pension managers, et cetera, have no alternative but to be in equities.”
“But they do have a choice about if they hedge, and if they hedge that risk,” he added. “And gold is a proven safe haven in that regard.”
Steel said gold’s rapid rise has pulled in many momentum traders, which increases the likelihood of a sharper downward correction. “I think that's where we have to be somewhat concerned, that if we get some days where things are static, we could easily get a pullback in the price,” he said, adding that he’s seeing a lot of demand destruction in the physical markets. “It's getting very expensive for price-sensitive economies to keep buying the underlying physical.”
Steel said that the newly arrived momentum traders “may or may not be well versed in the fundamentals of gold,” but are instead reacting to straightforward buy and sell signals as the gold market approaches record highs in nominal terms, and cautioned that these nominal values can be misleading.
“I would point out for your viewers that gold hit $850 an ounce in January of 1980, which if converted into today's dollars is $3,000, around $3,200,” he said. “Now, I'm not saying we're going to go there by any stretch of the imagination. But I would point out that, from a real term perspective, we're not at historical highs.”
Asked whether nominal all-time high gold prices will spur central banks to become sellers, Steel said that for the most part he expected the opposite.
“Almost one out of every three ounces of gold that was mined in 2022 went into a central bank, and not much less in 2023,” he said. “Now, I think we have seen some slowness this year. They're aware of the price as well, and it is high.”
Steel pointed out some examples of sovereign selling but said that according to the latest numbers, they’re very much in the minority. “The IMF released data a couple of days ago that showed a couple of central banks were sellers in March,” he said. “But I do think, over the long haul, that central banks are on balance, on a committed buy program. But they certainly don't have to buy at the rapacious rate they did in the last two years.”

24,"Jun 12, 2024",Gold prices jump as U.S. CPI cools more than expected,"(Kitco News) - Gold prices are seeing renewed buying momentum as consumer prices cooled more than expected in May, which, according to some economists, could give the Federal Reserve some room to ease interest rates this year.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged last month after April’s  0.3% increase, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. The latest inflation data was weaker than expected, as economists expected a 0.1% increase.
The report said that in the last 12 months, headline inflation rose 3.3%At the same time, core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices increased 0.2%, also missing expectations; according to consensus forecasts, economists were looking for a 0.3% increase. 
The report said that annual core inflation rose 3.4%. Although inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, it is down from last month’s annual increase of 3.6%. Economists were expecting an unchanged reading.
The gold market was seeing some modest buying ahead of the report and has seen renewed bullish momentum in its initial reaction to the inflation data. August gold futures last traded at $2,342.10 an ounce, up 0.62% on the day.
Michael Brown, Senior Research Strategist at Pepperstone, said that the latest inflation data could shift sentiment at the Federal Reserve ahead of its monetary policy decision later in this afternoon
“The May US CPI report is one that should provide the FOMC with some degree of further confidence in the disinflationary process back towards the 2% target, with headline CPI remaining unchanged on an MoM basis, for the first time since last June. Furthermore, core CPI slipped further on an annual basis, hitting a more than 3-year low at 3.4%.
Adam Button, head of currency strategy at Forexlive.com, said that following the inflation data, markets have fully priced in two rate cuts this year, with an 80% chance of a move in September.

On Thursday Weir spoke to Kitco Mining at THE Mining Investment Event of the North in Quebec City.

Lithium prices jumped 10x at the beginning of this decade before crashing. Weir sees signs of a recovery.
""I think a lot of low-grade tons came into the market,"" said Weir. ""We're in a surplus position. With EV penetration continuing to grow, we think we're sort of towards the bottom of that period. Inventories have been depleted, and we think higher prices are coming at us down the road.""
High prices earlier this decade and environmental concerns led to investment into alternate forms of lithium production, such as direct lithium extraction. Weir believes that the big oil companies will come out on top due to their expertise in chemical processing and their deep pockets. In November Exxon Mobil announced that it was drilling its first lithium well in Arkansas, the company’s first phase of North American lithium production in the southwest. The company said it aimed to be a leading supplier for electric vehicles by 2030
""There's a lot of companies putting a lot of capital into [lithium technology], including ExxonMobil,"" said Weir. ""It takes a lot of engineering hours to unlock. Every single project is discrete. If anyone's going to figure it out, it's going to be a company the size of Exxon.""
Lithium Royalty (TSX: LIRC) has 35 royalties. The company added eight last year. Expected producers in 2024 are Tres Quebradas, Mariana, and Das Neves. The company has a cash balance of $9.3 million, and the current market cap is C$391 million.

27,"Jun 11, 2024","Silver prices stabilize above $29/oz, but downside target of $24.66/oz is in play – FX Empire’s Hyerczyk","
(Kitco News) – Silver prices are stabilizing following the sharp slide across precious metals on Friday, but China’s pullback on sovereign gold purchases could mean stagnation and further declines for the grey metal, according to analyst James Hyerczyk at FX Empire.
“Silver prices stabilized on Monday after experiencing the steepest decline in over three years on Friday,” Hyerczyk wrote. “This correction came as disappointing news from China and the U.S. curbed speculator enthusiasm, particularly those banking on Chinese bullion demand and an anticipated interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.”
He said that Friday’s plummeting silver prices were driven by a double whammy of data from Asia and the United States. “This decline was triggered by a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report, which reduced the likelihood of a Fed rate cut in September,” he said. “Additionally, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) paused its bullion purchases after 18 months, disappointing investors who had bet on continued Chinese demand for gold.”
Hyerczyk said that the PBOC has been exerting considerable influence on bullion prices of late, but their buying patterns have been inconsistent.
“Historically, the bank’s buying phases are followed by long breaks, and without resumed purchases of gold, silver prices might remain stagnant,” he said. “Market sentiment was further jolted by Friday’s dramatic move, with expectations of similar volatility this week being low unless there are major surprises in upcoming economic data, particularly the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and the Federal Reserve’s policy decision.”
All eyes are now on the CPI release tomorrow morning, with the Fed’s interest rate decision and new projections coming in the afternoon. “Analysts predict May’s CPI will show cooling headline inflation, though core inflation might remain high, influencing the Fed’s decision-making process,” he said. “The Cleveland Federal Reserve estimates headline inflation at 0.08% and core inflation at 0.3% for May, reflecting cooling energy prices but persistent core pressures.”
Hyerczyk noted that expectations for a Fed rate cut in September dropped from 70% to around 50% following the release of the U.S. employment data, and nobody is expecting a change to the benchmark rate at tomorrow’s meeting.
“Policymakers are closely monitoring shelter and services prices, as these are significant inflation drivers,” he wrote. “The recent robust jobs report suggests the Fed will scrutinize inflation data more intensely before adjusting rates. While May’s CPI is likely to show moderated inflation, the path to the Fed’s 2% target remains protracted.”
Hyerczyk said that in the near term, he expects silver prices to remain under pressure. “With the Fed likely holding off on rate cuts and China’s demand uncertain, the market outlook leans bearish,” he said. “Any positive surprise in the CPI data could, however, shift sentiment temporarily. Traders should stay alert to economic releases and Fed communications this week for clearer market direction.”
Turning to the technical picture, Hyerczyk said that while silver prices have stabilized and have trended upward, the analysis doesn’t look bullish.
“XAG/USD prices are edging higher on Monday, but the market remains vulnerable to further downside pressure with the 50-day moving average at $28.77 the next target,” he said.

“The 50-day MA has been controlling the intermediate uptrend since March 1 so a sustained move under this indicator could cause some significant damage to the chart with the 200-day moving average at $24.66, a potential downside target,” Hyerczyk concluded.
After declining precipitously from the daily high of $29.808 shortly after 6 pm EDT to a session low of $29.032 at 10:30 pm, spot silver has managed to hold above $29.100 since, last trading at $29.255 at the time of writing for a loss of 1.65% on the session."

29,"Jun 11, 2024","Heightened geopolitical uncertainty has supported gold, but Crisis24’s Chad Lesch sees opportunities to ease global tensions","
(Kitco News) - Geopolitical uncertainty has provided significant safe-haven support for gold, and investors should expect this trend to continue as adversaries continue to chip away at the U.S. dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency, according to one risk management executive.
On the sidelines of the annual The Conference of Montreal by the International Economic Forum of the Americas, Chad Lesch, Senior Vice President of Strategic Projects at Crisis24, the world’s leading risk intelligence, crisis management, premier medical, and personal security company, said in an exclusive interview with Kitco News that aside from ongoing conflicts around the world, one of the greatest threats to the global economy is the further weakening of the U.S. dollar.
Prior to joining Crisis24, Lesch spent 15 years at the Central Intelligence Agency as a Covert Action Officer in their Special Activities Center. Lesch now uses his skills to help businesses manage risks and identify revenue opportunities.
Lesch explained that the growing multipolar world is helping to fuel geopolitical uncertainty as nations like China try to exert more control over the global economy. This is not just among the expanded BRICS nations—Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates—as Lesch said that China is now starting to further push its influence in South America.
“The trend of de-dollarization is a concern, but the best way to counter it is through a strong U.S. and Western economy,” Lesch said. “A strong Western-aligned economy is one of our greatest defenses against further turmoil.”
Lesch said that one strategy he would like to see is for the U.S. to improve its relationship with India.
He noted that improved economic ties with the world’s largest democracy would significantly support the U.S. dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. He added that India has more in common with the US than with China, both governmental and culturally.
“Building upon our relationship with India is huge for a variety of reasons. I think we can get there and it’s in the best interest of both countries,” he said.
A Diversified Global Supply Chain Could Ease Geopolitical Tensions
Lesch added that while geopolitical uncertainty creates obstacles for the global economy, it also creates opportunities. He noted that Crisis24 uses Artificial Intelligence to monitor threats to the global supply chain and economy. The company monitors a complex mix of reporting factors, some of which include weather patterns, elections, civil unrest, labor strikes, corruption, upcoming industry regulations, armed conflict, devaluation of currency, and vetted social media posts from governments and state services.
Crisis24 compiles all the data to provide companies with up to six-month outlooks on potential commodity supply disruptions around the world. Lesch used titanium as an example, as the market saw a massive supply disruption when Russia invaded Ukraine. Because of economic sanctions, Russia’s titanium exports dried up.
“A lot of companies that were reliant on Russia for titanium took an enormous hit,” he said. “But you can’t say that it’s not like we didn’t see that one coming. For two months before, Russia was lining up on the border of Ukraine with its military. Businesses had a two-month head start to try to find other sources. Prior to the invasion, Russia was not a top 10 exporter of the world’s titanium supply, so there are other sources out there that companies could have explored before the war if they were using the right forward-looking intelligence tools, which the US intelligence community calls Anticipatory Intelligence.”
A screen shot of Crisis24's platform that provides in depth analysis of commodity supply chains
Lesch used neodymium, an essential critical metal because of its magnetic properties, as another example. He noted that China produces 50% of the world’s supply; however, Crisis24 has flagged a potential market disruption in that supply. Lesch said companies relying on neodymium could start looking for new sources to protect their supply chain.
“Japan produces only 8% of the world’s neodymium, but it could be a place to start making inroads and connections. Malaysia is just under 7%, so you could start investing in resources there,” he said. “There are options out there. The world economy is quite resilient, but businesses need to stay agile and adopt proactive measures to mitigate risks.”
While there is a delicate balance in the supply chain, Lesch said he is optimistic that diversity in the global commodity supply chain could ease geopolitical uncertainty. Nations could use more diplomacy to resolve international issues so they don’t spook investment capital, potentially hurting their economy.
“Countries are less likely to go to war if everyone is making money and countries have the commodities and security their nation needs,” he said. “Businesses need to look ahead with actionable and reliable intelligence to diversify their supply chains when needed and build resilience. This approach not only ensures continuity but also reduces the likelihood of conflicts escalating due to resource scarcity.”
Conversely, Lesch added that taking these economic threats too far could lead to heightened tensions.
“If nations are completely cut off from the global supply chain and lack access to key commodities, they are backed into a corner. They have no other recourse but to take a harder line,” he said.
While there is hope that global economic tensions could ease, Lesch said that nations and companies need to be aware of a growing global threat: state-sponsored cyber terrorism.
In a panel discussion at the IEFA Conference of Montreal, Lesch said that cyber-attacks by state players have doubled in the past year and will only get worse. “I predict the longer the wars in Ukraine and Israel continue, the more covert action initiatives Russia and other adverse state actors will execute with cyber-attacks, critical infrastructure sabotage, and targeting western businesses. It’s going to get worse before it gets better.” "
30,"Jun 11, 2024","Stronger USD and weaker Chinese demand drag gold, but rally to resume in Q4 – ING’s Manthey","
(Kitco News) – Gold prices are facing new headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar and weaker Chinese demand, but the yellow metal will resume its rally once the Fed begins cutting rates, according to Ewa Manthey, Commodities Strategist at ING.
Manthey noted that gold prices have already fallen by 5% from the new all-time high above $2,450 set in May following the release of a strong U.S. jobs report and the news that China’s central bank bought no gold last month. The employment data boosted the U.S. dollar index even as the Chinese data dragged gold prices lower.

“Gold has risen almost 12% year-to-date, mostly amid optimism for a Fed pivot to monetary easing this year,” Manthey wrote. “Safe haven demand amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as buying by central banks, has also supported higher gold prices this year. However, May’s stronger-than-expected US jobs report has pushed back expectations on when the Fed may start cutting rates.”
“With inflation having remained sticky and the latest jobs numbers beating all expectations, our US economist expects the Fed to push their projections for rate cuts back, so they end up with two cuts in 2024 and four in 2025 instead of three and three,” she said.
Manthey added that if the Fed continues to delay the start of its rate-cutting cycle, gold prices could see a further pullback. “We expect gold prices to remain volatile in the coming months as the market reacts to macro drivers, tracking geopolitical events and Fed rate policy,” she said.
China also halted its sovereign gold purchases in May, ending an 18-month string of net buying, leaving their reserves unchanged at 72.80 million troy ounces. “This marked the first time the country’s central bank did not add to its reserves since October 2022,” she noted. “This has left gold vulnerable to more downside pressure.”

Manthey pointed out that China’s appetite for gold began to wane in April “when the People's Bank of China (PBoC) bought only 60,000 troy ounces, down from 160,000 ounces in March, and 390,000 ounces in February.” She said that high gold prices could continue to restrain demand in the near term.
She noted that investment demand did pick up in some regions last month, pushing global gold ETFs to post net inflows for the first time in 12 months. “During the month, Europe and Asia led global inflows while North America and other regions registered mild losses,” she said. “Global gold ETF holdings rose to 3,088 tonnes by the end of the month.”

Turning to the future outlook for the yellow metal, Manthey said ING expects gold prices to pull back slightly during the remainder of Q2. He believes geopolitical risks are already factored into current gold prices while the Fed continues to maintain high interest rates.

“We see prices averaging $2,300/oz in the second quarter and an annual average of $2,255/oz in 2024,” she concluded. “We see prices peaking in the fourth quarter, averaging $2,350/oz on the assumption that the Fed starts cutting rates in the second half of the year and the dollar and yields weaken.”"

33,"Jun 10, 2024","Forget the Fed’s monetary policy, safe-haven demand to define gold prices - BNP Paribas’ Fabien Benchetrit","(Kitco News) - A growing distrust of the U.S. dollar is a major factor behind gold’s ability to hold critical support even as the market prices out potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, according to one international bank.
Looking ahead, Fabien Benchetrit, Head of Target Allocation at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said he expects gold will continue to move higher as investors focus less on gold’s opportunity costs and more on its safe-haven value.
“Since COVID, the forces of globalization appear to be ebbing. A new ‘multipolar’ dynamic is developing involving de-dollarisation, deglobalization, and international tensions. This new framework benefits precious metals,” Benchetritc wrote in a report published last week. “They appeal to investors as they provide a hedge against both the risk of an erosion of purchasing power in US dollars and geopolitics.”
Uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance has created some significant volatility in the gold market. Friday, gold prices saw their biggest drop in two years due partly to better-than-expected employment data that caused markets to price out a potential rate cut in September.
While gold prices dropped roughly 3% before the weekend, the market has managed to hold critical support above $2,300 an ounce. August gold futures last traded at $2,329 an ounce, up 0.18% on the day.
Benchetrit noted that gold’s resilience is part of a broader trend. While down from its recent highs, the market is up nearly 28% from its October lows and up more than 12% since the start of the year.
“A good performance for an asset with no yield. It does not seem to matter whether real rates rise or the US dollar appreciates, precious metals are resilient,” he said.
Benchetrit added that not only are central banks buying gold to diversify away from the U.S. dollar, but they are also moving the bullion back within their borders. Nigeria, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia are some of the central banks he named repatriating their gold reserves from the Federal Bank of New York.
“In addition, China is no longer accumulating US dollar reserves and is gradually selling off its holdings of US Treasury bonds,” he said.
Benchetrit also said that Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, which make up the core BRICS nations and the organization's new members Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates, could be a new catalyst for higher gold prices.
“If they favor bilateral agreements in local currencies as an alternative to the dollar, a common currency pegged to a basket of assets including commodities could emerge, especially since these countries are the main producers of hydrocarbons,” he said.
In his report, Benchetrit also expects central banks to continue buying gold through 2024. The comments were made before China spooked the gold market after data showed that it didn’t buy end gold in May, ending an 18-month shopping spree.
“Demand for gold from central banks is not weakening, and the repatriation of their gold reserves from the US suggests a rising mistrust of a US-centric system,” he said.
Benchetrit said he expects retail investors to pay more attention to gold’s role as a safe-haven asset and ignore headwinds of higher bond yields and a stronger U.S. dollar.
“Both individual and institutional investors (asset managers, private banks) would appear to be underinvested: despite the high gold price, futures positions are below previous peaks as are the assets of the biggest gold ETF. This situation suggests the end of the rise in gold is not yet in sight,” he said."
34,"Jun 10, 2024","Bulls working to stabilize gold, silver markets","(Kitco News) - Gold prices are near steady and silver prices firmer in midday U.S. trading Monday.

August gold was last up $1.20 at $2,326.50. July silver was last up $0.365 at $29.805.
It’s an extra important U.S. data week, highlighted by inflation readings and the FOMC meeting. Barron’s says in a story today: “After Friday’s jobs shocker, it’s hard to imagine a bigger event than Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference on Wednesday for shaping the outlook for investors the rest of this year.” U.S. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar index spiked higher after the hotter jobs report Friday morning. The FOMC is not expected to take any new monetary policy action this week. The marketplace is putting odds at around 60% that the Fed will make a rate cut before November.

35,"Jun 10, 2024","Gold prices slide on USD strength after ECB, BoC cuts, silver longs hit four-year high – Heraeus","
(Kitco News) – Gold prices face near-term headwinds from a hawkish Federal Reserve rate policy, while silver is entering dangerous reversal territory with longs hitting a multi-year high, according to precious metals strategists at Heraeus.
In their latest precious metals report, the analysts noted that gold prices got a boost following two G7 rate cuts last week, but the move was short-lived.
“On 6 June, the European Central Bank (ECB) implemented its first rate cut in five years, reducing the interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, despite higher-than-expected inflation figures from May,” they wrote. “This move followed a similar rate cut by the Bank of Canada which reduced its interest rate by 25 basis points just a day earlier. These cuts reflect Western central banks’ shifting priorities to supporting economic growth rather than cracking down on inflation.”

The analysts pointed out that the euro:dollar exchange rate held up well in the wake of the ECB’s rate cut, but the greenback strengthened considerably on Friday, which exacerbated the yellow metal’s price weakness. 
“The expectation is that the dollar would weaken when the Fed finally starts to cut rates too,” they said. “Historically, dollar weakness has been positive for the gold price. However, no change to US monetary policy is expected at the Fed’s meeting this week. While the timing of the first interest cut from the Fed is not set, the markets currently project a high chance of a cut in September.”
Of course, the big news in gold markets on Friday was China’s announcement that their central bank paused its gold purchases in May after 18 straight months of net purchases. 
“This news may have hit sentiment towards gold, but precious metals seem to have been part of a broader sell off that impacted base metals which were also sold off steadily throughout the day on Friday,” Heraeus noted. “The longer-term trend for gold appears to be higher, but the price is still correcting its recent sharp rally. For now, the price is holding above previous support from $2,280/oz to $2,300/oz. Below that level the next price support could be around $2,200/oz.”
Gold is seeing a positive start to the week, with spot gold last trading at $2,303.75 per ounce, up 0.42% on the session at the time of writing.

Turning to silver, the analysts said that silver’s sharp slide on Friday erased its gains from earlier in the week. 
“The price had closed above $31/oz on Thursday but ended the week below $30/oz,” they noted. “Despite net ETF outflows in recent months, non-commercial positions on silver futures keep building up, an indication that hedge funds and other leveraged speculators have supported silver’s rally.”

“Speculative long positions have rebounded to a four-year high over the last two months, suggesting that funds and other speculators are joining the rally rather than taking profits for now,” they said. “However, as the net speculative position reaches extremes, the risk of a price reversal in the short term also rises, since this often coincides with peaks in the price.”
Silver prices are also seeing a strong rebound to start to the week, with spot silver last trading at $29.426 at the time of writing for a gain of 0.85% on the daily chart.

36,"Jun 10, 2024",Hydrogen vehicles will be the biggest source of platinum demand by 2030 - WPIC’s Edward Sterck,"(Kitco News) - Challenges with mine supply in South Africa, by far the world’s largest platinum producer, should support prices for the auto catalyst metal, says Matt Watson, founder of Precious Metals Commodity Management LLC.
On June 5 Watson recorded an episode of Green Rush with guest Edward Sterck, director of research, World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC).

Watson referenced a chart showing platinum supply decreasing to 2030, as operational expenditures rise and miners close unproductive shafts. “We’re heading into a zone where we’re going to be in a structural deficit going forward,” he said.
Sterck agreed, stating that “it's just fundamentally the combination of mine and recycling supply continuing to run short of demand.” The WPIC projects a negative 1.2 percent CAGR for ICE (internal combustion engine) auto catalyst demand between now and 2028. Continuing into the 2030s, hydrogen vehicles will become the biggest end source of platinum demand.
Events like “Diesel-gate” have stunted the demand for diesel vehicles. Sterck noted diesel’s market share has declined from 50 percent in 2015 to around 17 percent today. Higher emissions standards have increased PGM loadings per vehicle.
Watson said he worries there won’t be enough platinum to meet the demand for the hydrogen economy, forecasting 3.5 to 4 million ounces of platinum available, against 13 million ounces of PGMs that currently go into the automotive market.
Sterck put the number of available ounces higher due to recycling, mostly from end-of-life auto catalysts and jewellery made from platinum. The WPIC sees hydrogen demand for platinum growing to 900,000 ounces from 100,000 oz currently.
Sterck noted that with subsidies, heavy-duty hydrogen vehicles reach cost parity with diesel-fueled heavy-duty vehicles by 2030. However, US subsidies are lower, therefore, “we don't really have a huge amount of hydrogen demand for platinum in our base-case forecasts coming from North America. It's really a China and a Europe story.”

37,"Jun 10, 2024",Physical gold ETFs see first net inflows in 12 months in May - World Gold Council,"(Kitco News) - Volatility is picking up in the gold market as prices saw their sharpest decline in two years last week; however, the precious metal also showed strength as it attracted new investors last month.
In its monthly analysis of gold-backed exchange-traded funds released Thursday, the World Gold Council (WGC) announced that global flows turned net positive in May, ending 12 consecutive months of outflows.
However, investment demand still has a big hole to dig itself out of.
“With improved gold ETF demand in May, collective holdings rebounded to 3,088t, but remaining -8.2% below the 2023 average,” the analysts said in the report.
The WGC noted that Asian markets continue to see growing interest in paper gold investments. Meanwhile, European demand turned positive last month, while North American interest in gold was slightly negative.
In a regional breakdown, North American-listed funds saw net outflows of 2.3 tonnes, valued at $139 million. The WGC noted that May saw the smallest decrease in holdings since December 2019.
“Investor interest appeared to be drawn to spikes in geopolitical risks as sporadic gold ETF inflows coincided with upticks in the Geopolitical Risk Index,” the analysts said.
For the year, North American gold holdings have declined by more than 69 tonnes, valued at $4.3 billion.
Analysts noted that while geopolitical uncertainty has provided some safe-haven demand for gold, hawkish posturing from the Federal Reserve, as it maintains its restrictive monetary policy, creates some selling pressure.
Across the Atlantic, European ETFs saw inflows of 5.6 tonnes, valued at $287 million. However, the WGC noted that the market remains mixed as Eurozone funds attracted investors while UK funds saw outflows.
“Inflows were mainly driven by expectations that the ECB would cut rates in early June, as primarily reflected in Swiss and German funds: May marks the second occasion this year that Germany has experienced inflows, and the first time Switzerland has recorded inflows since July 2023,” the analysts said. “However, an earlier-than-expected UK election paired with stickier-than-anticipated inflation pushed back investor expectations for rate cuts by the Bank of England.”
While Asian demand is relatively small compared to the broader marketplace, it continues to attract significant market attention as investors, led by China, increased their exposure to gold ETFs for 15 consecutive months.
Asian funds saw inflows of 5 tonnes last month, valued at $398 million.
“Although this marks the region’s smallest inflow since November 2023, Asia’s continued inflow streak is the second longest on record,” the analysts said. “Key drivers of gold ETF demand in the country were the local gold price rise, which refreshed its all-time high, and continued weakness in the local currency.”
Analysts note that improved investor demand last month came as prices held critical support above $2,300 an ounce. Although gold continues to consolidate in a relatively wide range, it has held critical support.
Looking ahead, a growing chorus of analysts have said that gold investment demand should see significant improvement this year as the Federal Reserve embarks on a new easing cycle before the end of the year.
Gold suffered a significant setback Friday, seeing its worst selloff since 2022 after stronger-than-expected employment data pushed back the timing of the Fed’s first rate cut.
Although the U.S. economy continues to create jobs, some analysts have said that labor market data won’t stop the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates. Although 272,000 jobs were created last month, full-time employment dropped sharply while part-time positions increased."

39,"Jun 10, 2024",Gold price a bit weaker as bulls work to stop the bleeding  ,"(Kitco News) - Gold prices are posting slight losses in early U.S. trading Monday, with silver prices trading higher. The precious metals bulls are trying to stabilize their markets after Friday’s beat-down in the wake of a stronger U.S. jobs report that goosed the U.S. dollar index and U.S. Treasury yields. August gold was last down $2.70 at $2,322.30. July silver was last up $0.45 at $29.89.
It’s an important U.S. data week, highlighted by inflation readings and the FOMC meeting. Barron’s says in a story today: “After Friday’s jobs shocker, it’s hard to imagine a bigger event than Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference on Wednesday for shaping the outlook for investors the rest of this year.” U.S. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar index spiked higher after the hotter jobs report Friday morning. The FOMC is not expected to take any new monetary policy action this week. The marketplace is putting odds at around 60% that the Fed will make a rate cut before November.
Asian and European stock indexes were mixed overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward weaker openings when the New York day session begins.
Reports over the weekend said Saudi Arabia’s “petrodollar” agreement with the U.S., which expired Sunday, may not be renewed. The 50-year agreement was put in place in 1974. The petrodollar agreement saw Saudi Arabia sell its oil exclusively in U.S. dollars, with the U.S. promising military security and economic development. The reports said Saudi Arabia is now working more closely with China, which is trying to undermine the global dominance of the greenback.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index solidly higher and hit a four-week high. Nymex crude oil prices are near steady and trading around $75.50 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently at 4.46%.
U.S. economic data due for release Monday includes the employment trends index.

Technically, August gold bulls have lost their overall near-term technical advantage. A bearish double-top reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at last week’s high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the May low of $2,308.70. First resistance is seen at $2,335.00 and then at $2,350.00. First support is seen at last week’s low of $2,304.20 and then at $2,300.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 5.0.

July silver futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but have faded. A price uptrend on the daily bar chart has been negated to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the May high of $32.75. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $28.00. First resistance is seen at $30.00 and then at $30.50. Next support is seen at last week’s low of $29.22 and then at $29.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.5.

40,"Jun 07, 2024",Nothing has changed for gold except the price,"If you ever needed proof that algorithmic trading has dominated the marketplace, look no further than today’s price action in the gold market.The gold market took two significant hits Friday as black boxes traded only on the headlines instead of looking at the details in the broader landscape. In a single day, gold prices dropped more than 3.5%, the biggest intra-day selloff since 2020. Looking ahead, analysts have said that with this renewed selling pressure gold prices could eventually test support at $2,200 an ounce.Despite this dramatic selloff, the market’s fundamentals have not changed. But let’s look at the two events that spooked investors. Gold took its first hit during the Asian trading session. Data from the People’s Bank of China revealed that the central bank did not buy any gold last month.Looking at the reaction in the gold market, investors now believe that China’s central bank will never buy another ounce of gold again. China has been buying gold for the last 18 months; its ridiculous to expect that this trend would continue without some sort of pause. Stubborn inflation, geopolitical uncertainty, and diversification away from the U.S. dollar are reasons why central banks have voraciously bought gold and will continue to build their reserve. Even if gold purchases become more staggered, central bank demand will remain a solid pillar of support for the foreseeable future.“While China has positively contributed to the level of annual demand from the official sector, we are still confident that central banks as a whole will remain net buyers. Buying has been broad-based, with several other central banks continuing to accumulate gold, even as the gold price has increased in recent months. As such, while central bank demand for 2024 may not reach the levels seen in 2022 or 2023, we still believe that it will remain healthy for the remainder of the year,” Krishan Gopaul, Senior Analyst at the World Gold Council, in an exclusive comment to Kitco News.Gold took its second hit at the start of the North American session after employment data showed that the U.S. economy created 272,000 jobs, significantly beating expectations. At the same time wages increased 0.4%, also beating expectations. At first glance, it was a blockbuster employment report showing a healthy labor market. However, as markets digest the full report, economists have been busy pointing out that the data is not as robust as the headlines suggest.While the headline was better than expected, the household survey shows a dramatic decline fo 408,000 jobs. At the same time, the report also showed a significant drop in full-time jobs and a rise in part-time employment.People having to work more than one job to make ends meet is not a sign of a healthy economy.After talking to several analysts, the consensus is that investors should let the algorithms make their trades, and as they push the price lower, investors and traders can look for strategic buying opportunities. But that it enough from me. 
Have a great weekend"
41,"Jun 07, 2024","Wall Street throws in the towel on gold after Friday’s rout, Main Street optimism likely a pre-selloff snapshot","
(Kitco News) – This week, precious metals markets saved all their drama for the grand finale. Spot gold opened the week trading at $2,325.26, and spent much of the first four days trading in a relatively narrow $25 range. 
The expected 25 basis point rate cuts from the ECB and the Bank of Canada came and went, with spot gold eventually setting its weekly high of $2,386.75 just after midnight on Friday.
North American traders went to bed Thursday night expecting Friday morning’s nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report to be the week's highlight for gold. But the People's Bank of China (PBoC) stole the spotlight in the early hours, announcing at 4 am EDT that they had broken their 18 months streak of sovereign gold purchases in May and sending metals prices crashing through multiple levels of support as algorithmic stop loss orders were filled in rapid succession. 
Spot gold sank like a stone, falling from $2,373.85 just before 4 am to $2,343.68 only one hour later, with much of the move taking place in a matter of minutes.
Then, the yellow metal was trading at $2,333.42 in the moments before the 8:30 am release of the surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report, which drove gold down even further as markets recognized that the Fed would have even less reason to cut in the near term. As gold was already down over $40 at that point, the NFP took the yellow metal all the way down to support near $2,300 per ounce.
Gold saw multiple bounces off the $2,300 level throughout Friday trading, but finally broke through support shortly after 2:40 pm EDT. 

The latest Kitco News Weekly Gold Survey has the majority of industry experts throwing in the towel on gold’s near-term prospects, while most retail traders saw gains for gold in the coming week, though most voted before Friday morning’s fireworks.  
“Two forces drove gold to new one-month lows ahead of the weekend,” said Marc Chandler, Managing Director at Bannockburn Global Forex. “The first, and which got the ball rolling, was news that although the dollar value of China’s reserve grew last month, it did not add to its gold holdings for the first time in 18 months. The second, which added insult to injury was the jump in US rates and the dollar in response to the stronger than expected US jobs data.”
“A break of $2300 in the spot market targets the May lows near $2277,” Chandler added. “A break of the $2270 area could send the yellow metal down to the $2220 area.”
“China rugging the gold bulls like GME today,” said Adam Button, head of currency strategy at Forexlive.com. Button thinks gold has further to fall. “This China news is bad,” he added.
Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst at Barchart.com, said gold prices are likely to move lower in the days ahead.
“While I’m not reading anything into Friday morning’s spike move, a knee-jerk reaction to the comic relief known as monthly US employment numbers, August gold remains in an intermediate-term downtrend on its weekly chart,” Newsom said. “The contract’s short-term daily chart is also showing a downtrend that didn’t quite complete itself this past week. Much will depend on Friday’s close, though the initial reaction Friday saw August take out its previous 4-day low of $2,334.80. Now we’ll see if there were any sell orders waiting below that mark.""
“Positioned in inverse Gold and Silver ETFs as a hedge here, as the market has temporarily turned South,” said Mark Leibovit, publisher of the VR Metals/Resource Letter.
“I’m sticking with up, as support structure is still in place from the weekly chart,” said James Stanley, senior market strategist at Forex.com. “And for the first four days of the week gold held in a fairly strong position until finding resistance at 2378.”
“I think the driver around Chinese gold reserves could possibly be a trap door, and I don’t think the Fed is going to come off as overly hawkish next week,” Stanley added.
Colin Cieszynski, Chief Market Strategist at SIA Wealth Management, was weighing the implications of the jobs report ahead of next week’s Fed rate decision.
“The U.S. employment numbers mean it's less likely that the Fed's going to cut rates,” he said. “It's less likely they'll cut rates next week, and they're really under pressure to not cut rates. And that's been propping up the U.S. dollar, particularly in a week where Canada and Europe did cut rates.”
Cieszynski said this will also have a significant impact on the U. S. dollar, and on gold prices.
“That puts a tailwind behind the U.S. dollar and a headwind in front of gold in the near term, and other commodities as well,” Cieszynski said. “Anything that's priced in U.S. dollars has a headwind in front of it now, because this could boost the U.S. dollar a little bit in the short term.”
Looking past the surprising headline number, Cieszynski said that the most significant thing about the jobs report was its inflation data.
“The most important part was actually that wage inflation is going up again,” Cieszynski said. “I think a lot of people were hoping that maybe the Fed would signal a rate cut in July, but yeah… maybe September. You could still do two rate cuts this year, in September and December, one before the election and one afterwards.”
Cieszynski said that the downward price action from gold could be fairly dramatic, as its run-up provided few obvious areas of support. “It broke out over $2,160, and then it very quickly went to $2400, so the support is in at around $2,280ish, $2,285, and if that gets taken out, then back to $2,125, $2,150.”
This week, 18 Wall Street analysts participated in the Kitco News Gold Survey, and after Friday’s precipitous slide, few were optimistic about the near term. Only two experts, representing 11%, expect to see gold prices climb higher next week. Eleven analysts, fully 61%, predicted a price decline, and the remaining five, or 28% of the total, see gold trending sideways during the coming week.
Meanwhile, 184 votes were cast in Kitco’s online poll, with Main Street investors representing the ‘before’ picture of a relatively optimistic market. 107 retail traders, or 58%, look for gold prices to rise next week, the same proportion as last week. Another 33, or 18%, expected they would be lower, while 44 respondents, representing the remaining 24%, saw prices chopping sideways during the week ahead.

Next week will revolve around the Wednesday morning release of U.S. CPI for May, followed by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision in the afternoon.
Then on Thursday, markets will be watching U.S. PPI for May and weekly jobless claims, with the Bank of Japan set to announce their monetary policy decision in the evening. And Friday morning will see the release of Preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment.
Adrian Day, President of Adrian Day Asset Management, was among the minority who believe gold could stage a comeback next week.
“Friday’s drop after the U.S. payroll report is overdone, and suggests some holders were nervous weak hands,” Day said. “The concern is that the payrolls report pushes back the prospects of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, but no-one was expecting it at next week’s meeting; September was the earliest when a Fed rate cut was broadly expected. A lot can happen twixt now and then.”
“Moreover, the U.S. and the Fed are not the only game in town,” he added. “Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada have cut rates in the last weeks, with a few other small central banks. The global trend is definitely to lower rates.”
Day said that while gold might see some follow-through from today’s selloff, he thinks it will only be for a day or two, and only shallow. “By the end of the week, I would expect gold to be moving up again.”
Kevin Grady, president of Phoenix Futures and Options, was looking at the market dynamics on Friday after the sharp overnight selloff.
“When the market dumps like that, the rest of the day is no longer about the news,” he said. “The rest of the day is people hitting stops, and in that market, it gets into a rhythm of the day where people are liquidating. So when you enter a day as a trader, and you see people are liquidating positions, it just changes the day. People are thinking, are there more stops under the market? Did we hit all the stops? Where's the buying coming in?”
“As a trader, that's what I look for,” Grady said. “I remember standing in the trading pit for years and years, and that's what I would watch for. Where are the stops? The market sells off... are they continuing? When you see another dip in the market and it doesn't continue, and strong buying comes in, who's doing that strong buying? Where's it coming from?”
Grady said that the payrolls report just exacerbated an already declining market, but soon all eyes will move to next week’s data.
“Let's see what the CPI looks like,” he said. “I think that's going to be the key for us. We have to wait and see.”
He’s also very interested in what Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will say at next week’s post-FOMC press conference.
“No one's anticipating any rate movements, but it's all about the verbiage, and the dot plot,” Grady said. “Everybody wants to know, where do these guys all stand as far as their projections and how many rate cuts are coming in, or will there be [cuts]? You saw the ECB cut rates this week. I still say that inflation is hot. Everything that touches, every single person, food, rent, education, insurance, any of those prices. Inflation is 15 percent at least on most of those metrics and I think that these guys see it.”
Grady said he thinks it’s increasingly likely that the Federal Reserve will decide to bite the bullet and raise the inflation target above 2%.
“I don't know if these guys at some point are going to start raising their target a little higher and say, our number is no longer 2 percent that we're going to target, we're going to try to say maybe it's 3%. I think that discussion is being kicked around, and I think that discussion has to be had, because right now, I don't think it's prudent to cut rates. I just don't think it's warranted, but they're in a really tight spot because on all the servicing debt that they have, they're paying exorbitant interest rates, and especially if the ECB is cutting rates, the entire world is flooding into U.S. Treasuries at 5.2%.”
Grady said that the Fed will need to do something at some point. “We're holding up the world, and we're going to continue to pay an exorbitant amount for our debt to service our economy?” he asked. “That's why I think these guys are in a real pickle.”
“I think they'd like to [cut], but I think the only way they're going to be able to lower rates is if they say, our target’s raised a little, we're going to go to maybe 3%,” Grady concluded.
“Gold's chart looks really weak, which is not surprising,” said Phillip Streible, Head of Market Strategy at Blue Line Futures. “If you are looking for metals exposure, copper and silver have better fundamentals. Gold investors should take a bit of a break for now.”
“We are likely in higher timeframe bearish correction against the move up from 19001,” said Michael Moor, Founder of Moor Analytics. “The trade below 24343 (+1.3 tics per/hour) has brought in $122.3 of pressure.  The trade below 24216 (+4 tics per/hour) projects this downward $60 (+)—we have attained $109.6.  On 5/22 we left the minor bearish reversal warned about, and on 5/23 left another bearish reversal above.  These rolled into the (Q) and are OFF HOLD.  Decent trade below 23642 (-1.2 tics per/hour starting at 6:00am) should bring in decent pressure, likely for days.”
“Neutral,” said Naeem Aslam, Chief Investment Officer at Zaye Capital Markets. “Consolidation with a grind to the downside.”
And Kitco Senior Analyst Jim Wyckoff sees further declines for gold next week. “Steady-lower as chart damage inflicted recently,” he said.
Spot gold last traded at $2,294.01 per ounce at the time of writing, down 3.45% on the day and down 1.43% on the week.

42,"Jun 07, 2024","Gold price takes two massive hits, but fundaments remain strong ahead of FOMC meeting next week","(Kitco News) - A one-two punch has knocked gold down to the canvas, but although prices have room to move lower, analysts have said that investors should view this correction as a strategic buying opportunity.
Although gold continues to consolidate in a broad range, the precious metal is ending the week with massive volatility. Disappointing economic data helped push gold prices to initial resistance at $2,400 an ounce mid-week; however, that bullish momentum has proven unstainable as the market ends Friday in solidly negative territory, extending its losing streak to three weeks.
August gold futures last traded at $2,325.60 an ounce, down more than 2% on the day. Meanwhile, the precious metal is down nearly 1% from last Friday.
Silver is also being dragged lower, extending its losing streak to three consecutive weeks. July silver futures last traded at $29.46 an ounce, down 6% on the day and down 3% for the week.
The selloff started early Friday after data from the People’s Bank of China showed that the central bank did not buy gold last month, ending a record 18-month shopping spree. The disappointing news caused gold prices to drop by nearly $20.
While on the ropes, the market was hit with another $20 drop following more disappointing data. The U.S. economy created 272,000 jobs in May, significantly beating expectations. At the same time, wages increased by 0.4%, also beating expectations.
At first blush, the economic data prompted markets to once again shift their interest rate expectations and start pricing a potential rate cut in September off the table.
Although gold has suffered some significant blows, it is not down for the count.
Christopher Vecchio, Head Of Futures and Forex at Tastylive.com, said the employment numbers were not as healthy as the market thinks. He pointed out that there was a massive discrepancy between the government numbers and the household survey. The government numbers show robust gains; however, the household survey showed job losses of 408,000.
At the same time, there was a sharp drop in full-time positions and a rise in part-time employment.
“The data reflects what we are seeing in other reports, that labor market growth is starting to slow,” Vecchio said.
Analysts are also shrugging off China’s disappointing news that it didn’t increase its gold reserves last month. Many analysts have said it's not surprising that the central bank is taking a break after buying gold for 18 straight months. Many analysts see this as a short-term pause.
Michelle Schneider,  Director of Trading Education and Research at MarketGauge, said that despite gold and silver’s selloff, there has been no fundamental change in the market.
‘We still have geopolitical uncertainty, we still have inflation, and we still have government debt and spending rising uncontrollably,” she said. “These are all factors that continue to support gold and silver.”
Schneider added that for gold’s long-term bull market to send, world peace would have to break out, and inflation would have to fall back to 2%.
“That seems a little far-fetched for me right now,” she said.
Vecchio said that his year-end target remains $2,575 an ounce even with this pullback.
Although gold’s fundamentals remain strong, analysts are not expecting investors to rush into the market to try and catch the falling knife. Schneider said that gold prices could easily fall 10% in a normal correction, pushing support down to $2,200.
Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said he is also watching the $2,200 level.
“We may be seeing the beginning of a broad profit-taking from all the upside momentum from the lows of October to the peak in May,” he said. “The current move does not look like one that will end quickly. We should be prepared for gold to dive into the $2,200 area in the next few weeks, which would bring the price back to just above the March consolidation area and correct it to 61.8% of the October-May rise.”
Lukman Otunuga, Manager Of Market Analysis at FXTM, said that while the bears are in control, there is still a chance for prices to recover next week.
“The scales of power have swung back in favor of bears with further downside on the cards unless markets find fresh hopes of Fed cuts. This takes us to the week ahead, when the focus falls on the U.S. CPI and Fed decision,” he said.
Economists have said that while the stronger-than-expected employment data was surprising, the Fed remains more focused on inflation. A weak CPI report could put a September rate cut back on the table.
Along with the U.S. Consumer Price Index data, economists have said that markets will be sensitive to what the Federal Reserve has to say.
The U.S. central bank is not expected to cut rates in June or July, but next week’s meeting could continue to set the stage for rate cuts later in the year, which some analysts have said remains bullish for gold.
“The risk is that the chairman appears somewhat optimistic given the recent evolution of the US consumer, and if the May CPI report shows further inflation progress. We also look for the dot plot to show two cuts as the median for 2024 and four for 2025,” said bond market strategists at TD Securities.

43,"Jun 07, 2024","China’s shock pause on gold purchases overshadows jobs report, triggers algo-driven search for stops","(Kitco News) – The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) announced overnight that they bought no gold at all in May, triggering a sharp algorithmic selloff in precious metals, overshadowing the blowout nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report released later in the morning and leaving traders scrambling to determine where the selling would stop, and how low gold could go.
The news that China’s central bank broke its 18-month streak of net gold purchases hit the wires at 4:00 am EDT, and it sent shockwaves through the gold market as Asian and European traders immediately began liquidating their precious metals positions.
Spot gold sank like a stone, falling from $2,373.85 just before 4 am to $2,343.68 only one hour later, with much of the move taking place in a matter of minutes.
Then, the yellow metal was trading at $2,333.42 in the moments before the 8:30 am release of the surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report, which drove gold down even further as markets recognized that the Fed would have even less reason to cut in the near term. As gold was already down over $40 at that point, the NFP took the yellow metal all the way down to support near $2,300 per ounce.
Gold saw multiple bounces off the $2,300 level throughout Friday trading, but finally broke through support shortly after 2:40 pm EDT, with spot gold last trading at $2,288.51 per ounce at the time of writing for a loss of 3.68% on the day. 
Krishan Gopaul, Senior Analyst, EMEA at the World Gold Council, told Kitco News that even if the PBoC slows their gold purchases, he still expects other central banks to continue accumulating the yellow metal.
""The People's Bank of China leaving their reported gold holdings unchanged in May was notable, given the level of their additions since late 2022,"" Gopaul said late Friday afternoon. ""This seems, however, a continuation of the deceleration in purchases reported last month. Going forward, we have no indication as to whether this represents a temporary or more extended pause in their buying and will continue to monitor reporting in subsequent months.""""More broadly, while China has positively contributed to the level of annual demand from the official sector, we are still confident that central banks as a whole will remain net buyers,"" he added. ""Buying has been broad-based, with several other central banks continuing to accumulate gold, even as the gold price has increased in recent months. As such, while central bank demand for 2024 may not reach the levels seen in 2022 or 2023, we still believe that it will remain healthy for the remainder of the year.""
Colin Cieszynski, Chief Market Strategist at SIA Wealth Management, said that while the China news was clearly the catalyst for gold’s quick selloff, the market may be reading too much into what may be a one-month pause in the PBoC’s long-term accumulation trend.
“What it says to me is they're not just going to keep paying up forever and ever,” Cieszynski told Kitco News. “They've got a limit of how much they're willing to pay, and we've probably gotten to it. And if we notice since the beginning of April, gold kind of leveled off in this $2,300 to $2,400 area. Whether they're finished buying or whether they're just taking a break to see if the price comes back down and they can do better, it's hard to say.”
“Does it mean they're done, or did they have to take a break for any number of reasons? And if so, for how long? That's a big unknown,” he added. “And that's probably why we're seeing gold come back so much, because people just don't really know. Nobody can really predict that.”
Cieszynski also pointed out that the PBoC announcement wasn’t the only significant data out of China last night, and that’s why the base metals are also declining.
“Copper was going down all night, and I think that part of that was the Chinese trade numbers, imports were weaker than expected,” he said. “It's not just gold, because copper is getting hammered too. It's a bigger metal story as well.”
The overnight slide made for an unusual NFP day as market participants were more focused on the ebb and flow of the trades themselves than on interest rate expectations or the broader economic picture.
Kevin Grady, president of Phoenix Futures and Options, said that in situations like this one, computers lead the way, and humans are left scrambling as they try to predict where the market will stop.
“The market just reacts, that's the thing you have to realize,” Grady said in an interview with Kitco News. “People are not sitting there reading this data and making a decision that, oh, this is bearish, let me sell the market. These are all computers that are reading the data, so all these algorithms are reading this information, AI, all this stuff is reading the data, and it reacts to the data.”
Grady said that when the PBoC news came out, there were a lot of longs in the market, and many of the individuals and firms were still sleeping, so their stop-losses were being triggered automatically. He added that gold was due for a correction, as buying from central banks, and China’s in particular, was all that was propping the precious metal up of late.
“The market's come back a little bit, but you look even a week or two ago, when stocks started getting hit, the big declines, you didn't see it from gold,” Grady said. “The reason why they were declining was because they don't think they're cutting rates this year. I don't think it's happening, and I think that the market started to try to digest that.”
“Equities, I think, reacted appropriately,” he said. “Gold did not. I think gold held up extraordinarily well, we still had valleys in gold, but it didn't tank. And there were a lot of longs in the market. So I think any sort of sell-off just exacerbated these stops. The market hit these stops, and that's what the sell-off was about.”
Looking ahead, Grady said he doesn’t think the PBoC is done with its gold purchasing program. “One month is not a pattern,” he said. “It doesn't signify a pattern. So I'm not reading too much into it. If it's consistent over two or three months, then it's a different story, but right now, I think it's a smart play. [China] can't just keep staying in there. There's a lot of people that trade on that, saying, okay, they're going to be coming in, they're buying X amount every month.”
Grady said the PBoC may be trying to avoid trading against themselves, much as another central bank once did, to disastrous effect.
“It's similar to what the worst trade in gold history was, which was when [the Bank of] England sold their gold,” he said. “They announced they're going to sell their gold. They announced the dates they're going to sell. And literally a day or two before, the market would tank, they'd sell on the bottom, and the market would rally right back up. Literally the worst trade in the history of gold.”
“I think it's smart for these guys to back off a little and try to get a little bit of a discount,” Grady said. “It's a central bank, but still, they have parameters. They're not looking to hold up the entire world in gold markets.”"

Grandich spoke to Kitco Mining on Tuesday at THE Mining Investment Event of the North in Quebec City.

Year to date, gold has hit several all-time highs, and silver is up about 33%. Grandich attributed the run up to ""tremendous physical buying"" from Asia.
""It's unlike anything I've ever seen in the 40 years,"" said Grandich. ""[It] overcame the paper market, which has a tendency to be more bearish than bullish over time.""
Despite the high metal prices, mining equities have been muted. Grandich said interest in cryptocurrencies has come at the expense of precious metal shares.
""Crypto is eating junior resources’ lunch,"" said Grandich. ""[When] everybody saw this great increase in physical market [buying], they weren't seeing it correspond to the mining shares.""
Grandich also discussed gold versus copper, BRICS momentum and the U.S. economy during the election year.

45,"Jun 07, 2024","Double-whammy puts strong price pressure on gold, silver  ","(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are posting strong losses in early U.S. trading Friday, on a double-barrel hit from a strong U.S. jobs report and China’s central bank easing its gold purchases. August gold hit a four-week low and was last down $51.40 at $2,339.70. July silver was last down $1.207 at $30.15.
The just-released U.S. data point of the week, if not the month, saw the May employment situation report from the Labor Department and its key non-farm payrolls figure up 272,000. That’s well above the consensus forecast for up 190,000 and compares to the revised April report gain of 165,000 jobs. The May unemployment rate was 4.0% versus expectations for a reading of 3.9%.
The U.S. dollar rallied and U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply following the stronger jobs data. The jobs data falls squarely into the camp of the U.S. monetary policy hawks, who do not want to see U.S. interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
Wednesday’s ADP national employment report for May was a miss to the downside on jobs growth. This week’s JOLTS and Challenger job-cuts reports also suggested a less robust U.S. labor force. So the marketplace was especially “wrong-footed” with this morning’s stronger Labor Department jobs report.
The second hit to gold and silver came on overnight news that China’s central bank did not add to its gold reserves in May. That really spooked the gold market bulls. “China has been buying for 18 months, supporting gold’s record rally to $2,450/oz last month. While China may be slowing, we anticipate ETF demand to return to the fore as U.S. Treasury yields fall, pushing safe-haven investors into bullion,” said broker SP Angel.
Asian and European stock indexes were mixed overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward lower openings when the New York day session begins.
In other overnight news, China’s May imports were reported up 1.8%, year-on-year, while its exports rose 7.6%. Exports were higher than expected but imports were less than expected.
The 1Q Euro zone GDP was up 0.3% from the fourth quarter of last year and was up 0.4%, year-on-year. Those numbers were right in line with market expectations.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index solidly higher. Nymex crude oil prices are modestly up and trading around $76.00 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently at 4.422%.
Other U.S. economic data due for release Friday includes monthly wholesale trade and consumer credit.

Technically, August gold bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but faded today. Prices are scoring a bearish “outside day” down on the daily bar chart. Also, a bearish double-top reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at today’s high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the May low of $2,308.70. First resistance is seen at $2,350.00 and then at $2,375.00. First support is seen at today’s low of $2,330.60 and then at $2,308.70. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0.

July silver futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage. However, prices today are scoring a big and bearish “outside day” down. Also, a four-week-old uptrend on the daily bar chart has been negated to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the May high of $32.75. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $29.00. First resistance is seen at $30.50 and then at $31.00. Next support is seen at the overnight low of $29.835 and then at this week’s low of $29.505. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.5

46,"Jun 07, 2024",Gold price sinks as U.S. economy created 272K jobs in May,"(Kitco News) - The gold market is falling into a deeper hole dropping nearly $20 as the U.S. economy continues to see healthy job growth.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 272,000 last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The monthly figure handily beat market consensus estimates of 182,000.
Although the headline employment number beat economist expectations, the unemployment rate rose again last, increasing to 4.0%, up from 3.9% in April. Economists were expecting the unemployment rate to remain unchanged.
The gold market was already seeing solid selling pressure into the report after data from the People’s Bank of China showed that the central bank did not buy any gold last month, ending a record 18 month shopping spree.
Better-than-expected employment data have added to the selling pressure. Analysts note that solid growth in the labor market could force the Federal Reserve to delay interest rate cuts this year.
August gold futures last traded at $2,333.40 an ounce, down more than 2% on the day.
Gold has sold off as markets have started to price out a September rate cut. Thursday, markets saw a more than 70% chance of a cut after the summer; however, that has dropped to a roughly 50% chance following the employment data.
Along with the positive headline number, the report noted that wages could add to the persistent inflation threat. Wages increased 0.4% last month; economists were forecasting a 0.3% increase.
“Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 4.1%,” the report said.
May’s growth comes as the Labor Department downgraded employment numbers in March and May. May’s data was revised down to 165,000, down from the initial estimate of 175,000; at the same time March’s numbers were revised to 310,000 from the previous estimate of 315,000.
While markets are focused on the solid job gains last month, some market analysts note that beyond the headlines, the data shows some cracks in the economy.
In a social media post, Axel Merk, President and Chief Investment Officer of Merk Investments, noted that the number of people working two jobs remains at December’s all-time highs.
At the same time, some analysts note that full-time jobs declined sharply last month while part-time jobs increased.
Michael Brown, Senior Research Strategist at Pepperstone, said that while the latest employment report is causing markets to adjust their interest rate expectations again, it is unlikely to change the Fed’s outlook. He pointed out that inflation data continues to dominate sentiment at the central bank table.
“ FOMC members continue, unsurprisingly, to place greater weight on the inflation side of the dual mandate, and are likely to reiterate next week that they are yet to obtain the 'confidence' being sought on a return towards the 2% target to enable the first rate cut to be delivered. As such, the May CPI report, also due next Wednesday, is likely to be a much more significant event, particularly after the core CPI metric fell, on an annual basis, to a near 3-year low in April,” he said.  "

48,"Jun 06, 2024",Western investors may be late to the gold rally… again - Goehring & Rozencwajg,"(Kitco News) - If history is any judge, Western investors are once again positioning themselves on the wrong side of the gold trade as the precious metal continues to flow to the East, according to one natural resource investment firm.
In their first-quarter investment letter published last week, fund managers Leigh Goehring and Adam Rozencwajg noted that Western investors lost their influence in the gold market as they continued to liquidate their gold holdings in the first quarter of the year, even as prices continued to rally.
The analysts said the 18 physically gold-backed exchange-traded funds tracked by the firm saw outflows of 108 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024. A further 50 tonnes were liquidated in the six weeks following April 1.
“Western investors continue to sell their gold while Central Banks and Chinese and Indian retail investors continue to buy aggressively,” the analysts said in the report. “With gold making record highs, it is clear who is winning.”
Goehring & Rozencwajg noted that a trend is starting to emerge, similar to the last bull run from 1999 to 2011, when prices went from $253 to $1,900.
“In the 1999-2011 rally, Western investors only purchased gold at the very end, once the bull market was mostly over, and immediately ahead of a significant pullback. Gold can rally with little Western participation - it certainly did in the 2000s,” the analysts said.
Asian retail investors are also getting a little help in the tug-of-war with Western investors. Emerging market central banks, led by China, continue to buy gold at an unprecedented pace. The fund managers noted that India also bought 17 tonnes of gold in the first quarter of this year – as much as they did in all of 2023.
Goehring & Rozencwajg reiterated their view that central bank gold demand is signaling a change in the global monetary policy regime. They noted that these shifts have occurred when commodity prices were dramatically undervalued relative to financial assets.
“Prior periods of radical commodity undervaluation occurred in 1929/30, 1968/71, and 1997/99. Today’s Commodities are more radically undervalued than ever in the last 140 years,” the analysts said in the letter. “Just like in the past, we believe a monetary regime change is forthcoming and that the central bank’s massive gold accumulation signals that the change might occur much sooner than anyone thinks possible.”
Goehring & Rozencwajg said that gold and silver have embarked on a substantial bull market and are poised to see significantly higher prices.
“With central banks continuing to buy and Western investors retreating, the stage is set for the gold rally to continue,” the fund managers said. "
49,"Jun 06, 2024",Will silver hit $50 in June? Here's why China matters - Chen Lin,"
(Kitco News) - Silver's recent surge past $30 per ounce has the market buzzing, with some traders predicting it could hit $50 per ounce soon. This bullish momentum is driven by technical breakthroughs and strong demand dynamics, particularly from China.

Chen Lin, a fund manager and known precious metals investor, highlighted the significance of silver's recent performance in a recent interview with Jeremy Szafron, Anchor at Kitco News. As of today, June 6, 2024, silver is priced at $31.23 per ounce. Lin explains, ""Silver broke $30 a few weeks ago and has been staying above that level, which is very important. Historically, once silver clears the $30 mark and retests, it often rallies quickly to $50.""
China's influence on the silver market is significant. The Shanghai Futures Exchange reports that silver stockpiles are at a 10-year low, and the current trend suggests they could be depleted by the end of the year. Chen Lin points out, ""China's silver stock is dropping like a rock. This, coupled with a consistent 10% premium of Shanghai silver over New York prices for the past two months, indicates strong buying interest.""
This surge in Chinese demand mirrors what was seen with gold last year. Lin explains, ""Last September, Chinese investors began buying gold aggressively, leading to a significant premium in Shanghai. A similar trend is now starting with silver, indicating massive transfers of silver from the West to the East."" Reports confirm that Shanghai's silver inventories have declined dramatically, reflecting robust domestic consumption and investment demand.
The global silver market is currently experiencing a substantial supply-demand gap. Industrial demand for silver, especially in sectors like solar energy, is skyrocketing. Lin elaborates, ""The deficit in silver supply is reminiscent of the 1950s. We are seeing a historical deficit in silver, similar to the period when the United States stopped minting silver coins due to a shortage.""
According to the Silver Institute, the silver deficit is projected to exceed 300 million ounces this year. This is largely driven by the solar panel industry, which has seen a massive increase in silver consumption. ""Two years ago, the industry used about 100 million ounces of silver. Last year, it was around 200 million, and this year it's projected to surpass 300 million ounces,"" says Lin.
The situation is exacerbated by robust investment demand and industrial applications, such as in AI-driven data centers requiring significant copper and silver inputs. China's role is particularly crucial as the country ramps up its acquisition of these metals to support its technological and industrial advancements.
Investors are now looking at silver and gold mining stocks, with the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) reflecting these trends with notable gains. Over the past three months, GDX has increased by about 16%, showcasing growing investor confidence.
Chen Lin is particularly bullish on silver miners. He highlights the undervaluation in the sector, stating, ""Silver miners are very undervalued. We're living in very interesting times, and the upcoming quarters could be phenomenal for both gold and silver miners.""
As silver continues its upward trajectory, the influence of Chinese demand and the global supply deficit are critical factors to watch.

50,"Jun 06, 2024",Market optimism clashes with economic reality- David Hay,"
(Kitco News) - As the belief in a soft economic landing spreads, David Hay, Chief Investment Officer and Partner at Evergreen Gavekal, warns this optimism may be setting investors up for a harsh reality check. The idea that the economy will glide through current challenges without significant turbulence is widespread, but history and current data suggest otherwise.

The U.S. economy is showing signs of deceleration. The annual growth rate for Q1 2024 was 1.3%, down from 3.4% in Q4 2023, and Q2 estimates are following a similar downward trend. ""We're seeing GDP estimates revised downward, and the same for Q2. The economy appears to be slowing,"" Hay explained in a recent interview with Jeremy Szafron, Anchor at Kitco News. This slowdown is occurring amid persistent inflation, which has kept the federal funds rate at 5.25%.
Adding to the economic strain is the U.S. national debt, which has surged to $31.8 trillion. Corporate debt has also ballooned to around $12 trillion. This environment of high interest rates and soaring debt presents mixed outcomes for various sectors. ""High interest rates are really good news for wealthy companies and individuals, but they're devastating for less wealthy consumers and small businesses with floating rate debt,"" Hay points out. The federal government's delay in locking in lower interest rates has also added to its financial burden, according to Hay.
Nvidia's Impact and Market Dynamics
Despite these economic headwinds, the stock market, particularly tech stocks, shows significant gains. Nvidia, driven by the AI boom, saw its revenue increase by 262% year-over-year. The S&P 500 has risen by approximately 10% year-to-date. However, Hay advises caution. ""AI is real, but the stock market's future benefits often get over-discounted. Nvidia is a chip stock, and chip stocks are notoriously volatile.""
Hay also emphasizes the importance of commodities, especially copper and oil. With WTI crude oil priced around $75 per barrel, OPEC's influence remains strong. ""The demand for copper is tremendous, driven by the green energy transition and electric vehicles,"" he says. ""On the supply side, it's challenging to get new copper mines into production, even in places like Chile.""
In terms of oil, Hay foresees potential price increases. ""There's some degree of artificial suppression of oil prices by the Biden administration ahead of the election. Post-November, this suppression could wear off, leading to higher prices.""
Emerging Markets and the Debt Dilemma
Emerging markets, especially those interested in joining the BRICS+ group, such as Turkey, are gaining influence in the global economy. ""Emerging markets are buying gold like crazy. China and India alone are responsible for over 50% of global gold demand,"" Hay notes. This shift in economic power has significant implications for global markets and commodity prices.
Hay also highlights the U.S. debt situation. ""These kinds of deficits are like crystal meth—they give you a near-term boost, but long-term, they work in reverse,"" he says. 
In this environment, Hay advises investors to be cautious and selective. ""You can get 5% on a T-bill, which is a good place for some of your capital. Commodities, especially those that are breaking out, offer opportunities,"" he suggests. ""We are in a structural inflationary period, and inflation is one way the government might address its debt bind.""

51,"Jun 06, 2024",Gold prices will set new record highs in the second half of 2024 - Metals Focus,"(Kitco News) - Gold prices are once again flirting with resistance near $2,400 an ounce, and one research firm expects that it's only a matter of time before the precious metal sets fresh all-time highs.
In their weekly note published Thursday, analysts at Metals Focus said that the eventual monetary policy easing from the Federal Reserve will drive gold prices higher in the second half of the year.
“Later this year, we expect prices will rise again, with a new all-time high likely,” said Neil Meader, Director of Gold and Silver at Metals Focus. “After all, the recent $2,450 peak is lower, in real terms, than the 1980 one, which would have been around $3,000 in today’s prices.”  
With a new record peak in sight, Metals Focus expects gold prices to average around $2,250 an ounce for the year, a 16% increase from last year’s record average price.
The comments come as disappointing economic data and growing slack in the U.S. labor market have raised market expectations for the U.S. central bank to start the new easing cycle in September.
Even if the Federal Reserve maintains its aggressive monetary policy stance, Metals Focus does not see much downside for gold through the rest of the year.  
The analysts at the UK-based precious metals research firm noted several factors supporting gold’s breakout rally this year, even as the Federal Reserve has hesitated to lower interest rates.
Insatiable appetite from global central banks, a dire global fiscal outlook, geopolitical uncertainty, and China’s weakening economy have all boosted gold prices, helping them to weather headwinds generated by persistent strength in the U.S. dollar and higher bond yields.
“Whether they start this year or next, US rate cuts are coming,” Meader said. “It’s also hard to see the Middle East and Ukraine conflicts being resolved any time soon, and US/China tensions remain high. Lastly, as physical markets become more accustomed to higher prices, gold’s fundamentals should improve.”"
52,"Jun 06, 2024",ECB cuts rates but doesn’t commit to an easing cycle as inflation remains elevated,"(Kitco News) - The European Central Bank has become the second G7 nation to cut interest rates; however, investors should not expect that this is the start of a new easing cycle, which is not providing any new bullish momentum for gold.
After cutting interest rates by 25 basis points, the first move since rates peaked in September, ECB President Christine Lagarde explicitly stated that the central bank remains focused on bringing inflation down to its 2% target.
“Let there be no doubt in our commitment to tame inflation,” she said in a press conference following the ECB’s monetary policy decision.
Lagarde added that while the central bank expects inflation pressures to continue easing, the committee needs to see more data to be confident about further rate cuts.
The ECB has cut rates even as inflation has remained stubbornly elevated. According to updated staff projections, headline inflation is expected to rise 2.5% this year, 2.2% in 2025, and 1.9% in 2026. Inflation expectations for this year and next are slightly above March’s projections.
Europe’s stubborn inflation persists as the region’s economy remains sluggish. Staff projections see the eurozone economy growing 0.9% this year, 1.4% in 2025, and 1.6% in 2026.
Although the ECB is hesitant to signal further rate cuts this year, Lagarde admitted that interest rates are still restrictive and well above the neutral rate. However, she reiterated that the committee will not pre-commit to any decision.
“We need more data to confirm we are on this disinflation path. We know the path we are on,” she said. “But we don’t know the speed that we are traveling or how long it will take.”
The ECB’s relatively neutral forward guidance has provided little momentum for the gold market. Spot gold against the euro continues to consolidate at elevated levels, last trading at €2,181 an ounce, up 0.68% on the day. Gold against the euro is moving roughly in line with the broader market; spot gold against the U.S. dollar last traded at $2,375 an ounce, up 0.80%
Andrew Kenningham, Chief European economist at Capital Economics, said in a note that he viewed the comments in the ECB’s monetary policy statement as slightly hawkish and Lagarde’s comments as slightly dovish, as she downplayed some inflation threats, like rising wages in the first quarter.
Kenninghamsaid that while the ECB sees more rate cuts down the road, the committee is still in no hurry.
“We now think the ECB is most likely to cut rates twice more this year, in September and December, bringing the deposit rate to 3.25%,” he said.
In an interview with Kitco News, Axel Merk, President and Chief Investment Officer at Merk Investments, said overall long-term interest rates will be higher as inflation remains sticky; however, he added that historically, when central banks start to cut rates, a slowing economy forces them to go beyond initial expectations.
He added that he has little faith in official forecasts.
Lagarde: ""Despite the progress, inflation pressures remain strong...inflation outlook has been projected upward""-- yet ECB cut rates. sure, makes perfect sense.

53,"Jun 06, 2024",It’s still early as gold and silver miners have their day in the sun - Themes ETF’s  Krystkowiak,"(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices continue to consolidate around critical psychological levels, but the uptrend remains on solid footing as investors look for value through the entire sector, including within the mining industry.
In a recent interview with Kitco News, Taylor Krystkowiak, Vice President & Investment Strategist at Themes ETFs, said that gold’s ability to hold near record highs and silver’s breakout rally above $30 an ounce this year is finally starting to attract the attention of generalist investors.
He added that these investors who missed the rally in gold and silver are starting to turn to the mining sector as there is still plenty of value in the equity space.
“Just using the price-to-book ratio as a rough proxy for valuation, going back to 2011, the price-to-book ratio of both the S&P 500 and the miners were about the same, trading around 2 times their value. Currently, the S&P 500 is trading at around 4.8, whereas miners are at around 1.9. So there's a significant difference between the market's valuation and miners,” he said. “That's a long way to say: I think that there is more to run in both the gold miners and also the silver miners.”
While investor interest has been lackluster in the mining sector, to say the least, Krystkowiak noted that it hasn’t stopped gold and silver producers from improving their balance sheets as they see impressive margins. During the first quarter, the average All-in-Sustaining Cost (AISC) for gold producers was around $1,358 an ounce, compared to August gold prices hovering around $2,350 an ounce.
“Miners are seeing a margin of nearly $1,000 an ounce,” he said. “It’s no surprise that finally, with these significantly wide margins, you're seeing these miners come back to life.”
Although investor sentiment remains low compared to interest in the broader S&P 500, Krystkowiak said it is slowly improving. He added that the silver market, with prices over $30 an ounce, is a particularly attractive sector for investors.
The renewed interest in silver comes at an opportune time for Themes ETF, a relative newcomer to the precious metals market. Last month, the firm launched a new silver-miners-focused ETF, The Themes Silver Miners ETF (Nasdaq: AGMI). The Firm’s gold-miners-focused ETF, Themes Gold Miners ETF (Nasdaq: AUMI), was launched in December.
Looking at the broader precious metals market, although gold and silver have seen significant gains in recent months, Krystkowiak said that he expects prices to continue to trend higher through the rest of the year.
Western investors have hesitated to enter the gold market as the Federal Reserve has maintained its aggressive monetary policies. However, Krystkowiak said that sentiment is shifting as economic activity starts to slow.
Looking through the second half of the year, Krystkowiak said he expects investors will continue to turn to gold and silver to hedge against stubbornly elevated inflation and weakening growth.
“There is a strong macro case for investors to hold broader commodities and miners as a stable store of value,” he said.
At the same time, Krystkowiak said that along with higher commodity prices, a correction in the broader equity market, as the economy slows, could push investors looking for value into the mining sector, sparking a sharper rally.
Along with a pickup in retail investors, Krystkowiak added that he also expects central banks to continue increasing their gold reserves. Unprecedented central bank demand is not only proving a solid floor for gold prices, but is also generating value for the mining sector, he said.
“Gold miners will continue to produce as much gold as they can to meet central bank demand,” he said.
While central bank purchases are eating into annual gold production, Krystkowiak noted that growing industrial demand continues to push the silver market into a supply deficit.
“If you look around, It feels to me like this may be the early innings of a resurgence in miners,” he said. “They're finally having their day in the sun.” "
54,"Jun 06, 2024",Gold price holding steady against euro after ECB cuts rates as expected,"(Kitco News) -  The gold market is not seeing much reaction in global currency markets as the European Central Bank cuts interest rates by 25 basis points across the board.
In a much-anticipated move, the ECB said the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility, and the deposit facility will be decreased to 4.25%, 4.50%, and 3.75%, respectively, with effect from 12 June 2024.
The gold market is seeing only some modest buying momentum in its initial reaction to the interest rate cut. Spot gold against the euro last traded at €2,168.44 an ounce, up 0.14% on the day.  
The ECB noted that its rate cut comes as inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points since September 2023, adding that the inflation outlook has “improved markedly.”
“Based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission, it is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady,” the central bank said in its monetary policy statement.
While easing inflation pressures have allowed the ECB to loosen its monetary policy, some analysts have said that Thursday’s cut was necessary as the region’s economy has weakened since the start of the year.
In a recent interview with Kitco News, Nitesh Shah, Head of Research at WisdomTree, said that the ECB is a little late to the game, which could lead to aggressive easing as it tries to catch up to support economic activity.
In its updated economic projections, the ECB sees the eurozone economy growing 0.9% this year, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.
The rate cut also comes as the ECB sees inflation stubbornly elevated. Headline inflation is expected to rise 2.5% this year, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026.
“The latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation have been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections,” the central bank said in its statement.
Although the ECB has started to ease interest rates, it remains reluctant to signal the start of a new easing cycle.
“The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path,” the statement said.
Michael Brown, Senior Research Strategist at Pepperstone, said that the muted market reaction to the cut is not surprising as the move has been well-telegraphed since March.
Although he is expecting to see two more cuts this year, in September and December, Brown said that risks are tilted to the hawkish side.
“Policymakers are clearly attempting to give themselves as much flexibility as possible,” he said.
The ECB has become the second of the Group of Seven central banks to cut interest rates. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada cut its overnight rate by 25 basis points and signaled more rate cuts to come this year.

58,"Jun 05, 2024","Gold is insurance against the risks of 2024, including U.S. election strife, China trade conflict, debt spiral – Ray Dalio","
(Kitco News) – Diversification is even more important to investors’ returns than making the right decisions, and gold is a key diversifier, according to Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates.
In a remote video speech to the Greenwich Economic Forum in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Dalio went through some of what he considered the most pressing economic and geopolitical threats on the horizon.
He said that among the most significant risk factors in 2024 are the threat of internal conflict surrounding the elections in the United States. “There are two questions related to that,” he said. “Will the elections be accepted by both sides? And what are the consequences of that? We honestly don't know the answer.”
Dalio said he sees reasons for concern, even assuming the election results are accepted.
“There are also very big differences between the policies of what would be a Trump administration and what would be a Democratic administration, particularly the issue of left/right,” he said. “Both parties have moderates and have extremists. And in both cases, there will be likely conflict between the extremists.”
He also contrasted the likely economic policy differences between the two administrations. “In the Trump presidency, you're getting much more of a nationalistic, isolationist, protectionist type of policies that are of the right, and are likely to offer more protections to those who have large amounts of money, the wealthy and the corporations. And of course, on the left, most of those policies are somewhat different. But the one thing that there's broad agreement on is the, as I would say, ‘anti-China’ policies.”
“In 2024, we are going to learn a lot about these, and what the policies will be,” he said.
Dalio said that history shows that “economic warfare precedes military warfare,” and that while he doesn’t expect an imminent military conflict between the largest and second-largest economies and militaries, on the issue of Taiwan, the one-China policy “will not go on forever.”
He added that this situation has forced international investors to wonder whether they will suffer from actions taken by their own government. “American investors investing in China could experience negative consequences from their governments,” Dalio said. “And there’s worry that from the Chinese side they could make it challenging.”
The stock market slides in Hong Kong and on the mainland earlier this year were indications that those concerns are valid, Dalio said, but he now sees Chinese assets as very attractively priced.
He also highlighted the role played by the relatively neutral states in Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East, saying that neutral countries often outperform even the winners in a war.
Turning to the topic of asset classes, Dalio said he prefers equity assets over debt, as he worried about the latter failing to provide adequate returns. Central banks own a lot of debt and are currently sitting on losses that they may have to monetize, which he called a classic late-cycle inflationary consequence.
Dalio also insisted that gold should be in every investor’s portfolio, as it is the third-largest reserve currency, trailing only the U.S. dollar and the euro.
“The power of diversification is greater than the power of even good decision-making,” he said.
Speaking on the Finimize podcast on June 1, Dalio expanded on his position relating to gold, saying that it plays a key role in his approach to risk, particularly when too much money is betting on continued gains in equities.
“If you're going to diversify, I suspect that most of your investors have probably a disproportionate amount of investment being long in the stock market,” he told host Gilberto Santos. “You know, always being on one side of the market, and always being in one market, is a risky thing. I would have a bit of gold.”
“A bit of gold is something that is a very effective diversifier,” he continued, “so actually adding gold to the portfolio raises its expected return without depending on the particular assets held in the portfolio, but it diversifies. It's almost a bit of an insurance policy.”"
59,"Jun 05, 2024","Jeffrey Gundlach: Never-ending debt-based scheme is pushing people to gold, Bitcoin","
(Kitco News) – The state of the global economy has emerged as a primary concern in the minds of investors around the world, and according to one CEO, prolonged higher interest rates in the U.S. could lead to a recession as soon as this year. 
 
According to Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief executive of investment management company DoubleLine Capital, there are signs of trouble brewing in the U.S. economy – including rising credit card delinquencies and softer retail sales data – which suggest the possibility of an economic contraction is more imminent than the risk of an inflationary rebound. 
 
""There's a lot of recessionary signals out there,"" he said while speaking at a webinar hosted by David Rosenberg, founder and president of Rosenberg Research. ""There's more of a recessionary feel than an inflationary feel.” 
 
The ‘Bond King’ added that he was staying away from the riskiest parts of the corporate debt market, such as triple-C rated companies' bonds and private credit investments, as he expects companies' debt defaults to surge.
 
When it comes to private credit, Gundlach warned that investors looking for higher returns in private markets rather than in public debt markets run the risk of remaining stuck with illiquid assets in case of a sharp economic slowdown.
 
""There is no factor on which private credit looks better than public credit at the present moment,” he said. “It's riskier, it doesn't have the same reward, it's the absolute worst.” 
 
For this reason, Gundlach said DoubleLine is heavily exposed to U.S. government debt. 
 
""We have more Treasuries now in our strategies than we've ever had,"" he said, despite concerns over rising U.S. debt levels and soaring government interest debt payments caused by higher rates.
 
Gundlach suggested that, over time, a growing debt burden could lead to the need to restructure U.S. government debt, which is why he focuses on low-coupon Treasury bonds. 
 
“I've got this crazy idea that I want to buy only the lowest coupon Treasuries ... because if I have a very low coupon Treasury, I don't have to worry about being restructured,"" he said. ""I worry that the federal government might be forced to restructure the Treasury debt.”
 
As for other trades that Gundlach is eyeing, he said, “Commodities could be your real asset play,” during a separate interview with DoubleLine Captial portfolio manager Sam Garza.
 
“Gold is getting long in the tooth… I think it's up about $40 today,” he said during the May 23 interview. “It’s just amazing. Gold was one of my number one recommendations for 2024, but I sure as heck didn’t think it was going to go up 25% in three months.” 
 
When asked if he had any speculation on why gold has gone on this run, Gundlach said, “I think there is just growing awareness that developed country governments are completely out of control.” 
 
“I feel like the average person is starting to realize the gravity of this problem… that we are running on a debt-based scheme with no end in sight,” he added. “And I just think that people are starting to think that, ‘Maybe I should own something that is real money.’”
 
“It’s probably not a coincidence that Bitcoin is up a lot too, on a year-to-date basis,” he added. “They are both part of the same phenomenon. Also, the animal spirits were out there, too with Nvidia momentum. Bitcoin certainly plays into that as well.”
 
Gundlach also warned that Social Security will run out of money within four years if the program isn’t restructured. “I’m going to say that Social Security runs out of money without a restructure by 2028,” he said. "
60,"Jun 05, 2024","$4,800 gold by 2030 ‘sounds pretty realistic’ - Ronnie Stoeferle","
(Kitco News) - The precious metals market is heating up, with gold up over 14% on the year, and silver prices up over 26%. As of June 5, 2024, gold trades at $2,346 per ounce, while silver is priced at $29.63 per ounce. This surge is driven by increasing demand from emerging markets and strategic moves by central banks, signaling a new phase in the gold bull market.
Ronnie Stoeferle, Managing Partner at Incrementum AG, believes we're witnessing classic early bull market behavior.

""We're now in a new stage of this gold bull market,” he said in a recent interview with Kitco News AnchorJeremy Szafron. “What we're seeing in markets is classic early bull market action. Miners are leading the price of gold. Silver is outperforming gold.” 
The gold-silver ratio, which measures the amount of silver needed to buy one ounce of gold, has declined to around 79, showing silver's strong performance relative to gold.
Gold Mining Stocks on the Rise
Gold mining stocks, particularly those tracked by the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), are seeing notable gains. Over the past three months, GDX has increased by about 13%, reflecting growing investor confidence. ""Miners are leading the price of gold. They're outperforming gold,"" Stoeferle emphasized. This growth in GDX underscores the health of the mining sector with rising gold prices, even as operating costs are still inflated.
The GDX's performance is significant because it represents a broad range of gold mining companies, which often act as a leveraged play on the price of gold. When gold prices rise, mining stocks tend to rise even more as their profit margins increase. This is due to the relatively fixed costs of mining operations, meaning that higher gold prices directly translate into higher profits.
Emerging Markets Fueling Demand
One of the main drivers of this bull market is the soaring demand from emerging markets. ""The emerging markets are buying gold like crazy,” Stoeferle noted. “China and India alone are responsible for more than 50% of all gold demand. If you include the Arabic countries, Turkey, Russia, you end up with two-thirds up to almost 70% of all gold demand.” This shift shows that traditional Western markets are no longer the primary drivers of gold demand.
Turkey’s interest in joining BRICS+ (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and additional partner countries) further highlights this shift. As Turkey aligns more with BRICS+, it aims to strengthen its economic ties and increase its gold reserves, reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar.
Central banks' significant gold purchases, especially since the Ukraine invasion, have also played a critical role. ""Central banks have put in a floor under the gold price since the invasion of Ukraine... Central bank demand has tripled,"" Stoeferle added. This has provided strong support for gold prices, ensuring stability despite economic uncertainties.
Stoeferle is optimistic about the future of gold, projecting a long-term price target of $4,800 by 2030. 
""We put out that model in the In Gold We Trust report 2020 and said $4,800 U.S. dollars, that's our long-term price target for the end of this decade,” he said. “$4,800 bucks sounds spectacular, but it's like 10-12% CAGR for the next couple of years until 2030. That sounds pretty realistic.”

61,"Jun 05, 2024",Gold prices jump against loonie as Bank of Canada cut rates by 25 basis points,"(Kitco News) - Global interest rates have likely peaked as the Bank of Canada is the second major central bank to embark on a new easing cycle.
Gold prices are spiking against the Canadian dollar as the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing its overnight rate to 4.75% with the Bank Rate at 5% and the deposit rate at 4.75%.
The cut was relatively in line with market expectations as inflation in Canada continues to weaken.
“With continued evidence that underlying inflation is easing, Governing Council agreed that monetary policy no longer needs to be as restrictive and reduced the policy interest rate by 25 basis points. Recent data has increased our confidence that inflation will continue to move towards the 2% target,” the BoC said in its monetary policy statement.
In global currency markets, gold is holding solid gains against the Canadian dollar in its initial reaction to the BoC’s rate cut. Spot gold last traded at C$3,207.54 an ounce, up 0.64% on the day.
While markets are mostly focused on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, the Bank of Canada’s rate cut signals a new shift in the global economy. It is the second major central bank to cut rates. The Swiss National Bank was the first major central bank to embark on a new easing cycle.
Looking ahead, there are growing expectations that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates on Thursday as its economy continues to struggle.
In this environment, many economists expect that the Federal Reserve will soon start to ease interest rates. Markets have a roughly 70% chance of moving in November.
Along with its rate cut, the Bank of Canada presented a relatively positive outlook for the domestic economy.
“Overall, recent data suggest the economy is still operating in excess supply,” the monetary policy statement said.
Stephen Brown, Deputy Chief North America Economist at Capital Economics, said that he expects this will be the first of many.
“The dovish tone of the accompanying communications suggests that another rate cut in July is already nailed on. For now, our forecast is that there will be three more 25 bp cuts this year, implying that the Bank will pause at one of its meetings, but if anything, the odds seem to favour cuts at every meeting,” Brown said in a note.
The Bank of Canada has said that it expects inflation to continue trending lower toward its 2% target, but it remains focused on keeping inflation on its current path.
“ Governing Council is closely watching the evolution of core inflation and remains particularly focused on the balance between demand and supply in the economy, inflation expectations, wage growth, and corporate pricing behaviour. The Bank remains resolute in its commitment to restoring price stability for Canadians,” the central bank said."

On Wednesday, ADP said that 152,000 jobs were created last month. The report missed expectations, as consensus forecasts called for job growth of around 173,000.
“Job gains and pay growth are slowing going into the second half of the year,” said Nela Richardson, Chief Economist at ADP. “The labor market is solid, but we're monitoring notable pockets of weakness tied to both producers and consumers.”
The gold market is seeing solid gains in initial reaction to the latest employment data. August gold futures last traded at $2,356.40 an ounce, up 0.37% on the day.
Along with the disappointing headline data, the report noted weaker wage inflation. Year-over-year pay gains for people who changed jobs fell for the second month; pay for job-changers was up 7.8%. At the same time, wages for people who stayed in their jobs held steady for the third month at 5%.
The report noted that the U.S. economy saw modest broad-based job growth through all sectors; however, the biggest move was in the manufacturing sector, which lost 20,000 jobs last month. Meanwhile, within the service sectors, trade/transportation/utilities saw the biggest gains, creating 55,000 new positions in May.
Growing slack in the U.S. labor market continues to support growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will loosen its monetary policy before the end of the year. Markets see a more than 70% chance of a rate cut in November.
Commodity analysts have said that while gold is consolidating around $2,350 an ounce, there is still a lot of interest in the precious metal. A Federal Reserve rate cut could spark new investment flows into gold and silver. "

65,"Jun 04, 2024",Gold’s attractiveness to criminals forces market participants to shoulder the AML-KYC burden,"
(Kitco News) – The biggest gold-smuggling bust in Hong Kong’s history has brought the challenges of detecting illegal movements and transactions of precious metals into sharp relief, according to a June 2 report from consulting firm Alvarez and Marshall.
“On 27 March 2024, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department made its largest ever gold-smuggling bust — approximately 146kg, with an estimated market value of HKD 84 million — at the Hong Kong International Airport,” the report stated. “The gold was not smuggled as ingots or jewelry with serial numbers as one might expect, but was disguised as parts for air compressors.”
Authors Henry Chambers and Benjamin Teo wrote in ‘Following the Midas Trail – Laundering Money Through Gold and Precious Metals’ that cases such as this one raise an important question: “Can forensic practitioners trace the movement of luxury items, such as physical gold, and how are these valuable items controlled?”
“Money laundering is the process of making illegally obtained gains appear “clean,” and typically follows a three-stage process — placement, layering, and integration,” they said. “Because of the scrutiny given to bank transactions, criminals may turn to gold or other precious metals when they need to launder money.”
Chambers and Teo argue that precious metals are attractive assets for criminals who wish to conceal the origins of any illegally obtained money, using the process outlined in the following diagram:

The authors ask whether it is possible for forensic investigators such as themselves to trace the movement of illicit funds through the movement of gold.
“The international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) designates dealers in precious metals and precious stones, amongst others, as Designated Non-Financial Business Professionals (DNFBPs) and recommends implementing a risk-based anti-money laundering (AML) approach in these industries,” they wrote. “In this light, since 1 April 2023, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department has commenced a registration regime for dealers in precious metals and stones.”
The regime applies to businesses involved in “trading […] exporting or importing precious metals, precious stones or precious products; Manufacturing, refining or carrying out any value-adding work on precious metals, precious stones or precious products; Issuing, redeeming or trading in precious-asset-backed-instruments; or Acting as an intermediary in any of the above.”
The first step in the use of gold for money laundering is placement, they said.
“Essentially, in Hong Kong the use of cash to purchase gold valued above HKD 120,000 in a single transaction or several seemingly linked transactions triggers customer due diligence requirements,” the authors said. “The dealer is then obliged to obtain and verify information such as the beneficial owner’s identity. Based on the assessed risk, the dealer may also need to understand the customer’s source of wealth/funds or other additional information.”
“On gold bars, generally, details of its owner can be verified through engravings that detail its weight, purity and manufacturer, along with an accompanying certificate of authenticity,” Chambers and Teo note. “If the gold bar is sold by an intermediate dealer and not the manufacturer, the intermediate dealer will be subject to local AML requirements and will likely have records of its customers.”
Gold bars can also be “embossed with kinegrams or security holograms” similar to those found on modern banknotes. “These security devices provide an additional layer of comfort with regard to the authenticity of a gold bar’s declared weight, purity and serial number,” they said. “This, in turn, provides comfort as to the true identity of the buyer.”

The next step in the laundering process is layering, where the gold is moved through multiple transactions and jurisdictions to cover up the trail.
“If gold is purchased or sold from or to a non-reputable dealer, or over-the-counter from or to another individual, its subsequent movement may be difficult to track, especially if its serial number, security features and certificate of authenticity have been tampered with,” the authors wrote. “Tracking can be further complicated as large amounts of gold and other precious metals can easily travel between jurisdictions undetected in suitcases or pockets or openly in the form of jewelry.”
Once the gold has been moved through these steps and locations, the criminals will attempt different ways of fulfilling the final stage of the money-laundering process, integration, where the value is merged with other legitimate assets or funds.   from location to location,
“[C]riminals may try to liquidate the gold at other dealerships,” Chambers and Teo said. “Reputable dealers will care about the authenticity of the gold, and criminals may find liquidizing gold bars with no serial numbers to be relatively difficult. However, less scrupulous dealers in other countries may take the opportunity to undercut the seller, allowing the criminals to cash out their criminal proceeds as clean money.”
They said that these jurisdictions “may not have effective AML regulations, and less scrupulous dealers will not keep records of their buyers and sellers,” which makes tracking the flow of assets far more difficult.
“Alternatively, as in the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department’s case, gold can also be easily melted by money launderers and remolded into other items or jewelry to sell,” the authors wrote. “This process necessarily removes the serial numbers, hence hiding the gold’s origins, and may allow for easier integration due to the lower absolute value of each item. This jewelry can subsequently be sold to customers directly or to other intermediaries.”
Chambers and Teo note that a large part of the AML-KYC burden in the present-day precious metals market system falls to the DNFBPs.
“As mentioned above, the FATF and the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department issue guidelines on how gold dealers, manufacturers and intermediaries should adopt a risk-based approach and implement customer due diligence, ongoing monitoring, screening and staff training processes, as well as file suspicious transaction reports when necessary,” they said. “This is not unlike measures that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority requires financial institutions to carry out when dealing with customers. Therefore, as in banking, this puts the emphasis of maintaining a clean industry on its gatekeepers.”
“The attractiveness of gold as both an asset and as a vessel for money laundering not only requires its gatekeepers to remain vigilant, but also protect the market’s reputation by understanding its patterns and trends,” they concluded. “It is in these stakeholders’ interests to engage with the regulators and enforce relevant requirements, to avoid prosecution and pecuniary penalties, to maintain their status as a reputable business, and to prevent criminals from laundering gold.”

66,"Jun 04, 2024","Gold, silver see sharp losses amid crude oil downdraft","(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are sharply lower in midday U.S. trading Tuesday, due in part to a big sell off in crude oil prices this week that has sent shudders through the entire raw commodity sector. Weak long liquidation and profit taking from the shorter-term futures traders was featured in both metals markets today. August gold was last down $26.60 at $2,342.60. July silver was last down $1.174 at $29.605.
Featured in the marketplace this week is the drop in crude oil prices. Nymex crude oil futures overnight slumped to a four-month low of $72.48 and in the past three trading sessions prices have lost over $5.00 a barrel. The drop in oil prices comes as OPEC has just agreed to extend its existing production cuts. Worries about slowing global economic growth are prompting much of the selling pressure on crude oil. There are also doubts OPEC can hold together its collective output reduction quotas for an extended period. Raw commodity sector leader crude oil’s price downdraft is also spilling over into selling pressure in other raw commodity markets this week. If oil prices continue to drop, most other raw commodity markets will have a much harder time scoring price gains.
A Dow Jones Newswires headline today reads: U.S. rate cuts likely to win back Western gold investors.” The story says World Gold Council chief market strategist John Reade said elevated U.S. interest rates have hurt U.S. and European demand for gold. However, he said investment interest in the yellow metal has held up well due to better demand from global central banks, especially emerging countries’ central banks.
The U.S. data point of the week, if not the month, comes with Friday’s May employment situation report from the Labor Department. The key non-farm payrolls number is seen coming in at up 178,000 versus the April report showing a gain of 175,000 jobs.
Investors and traders are also anticipating Thursday’s European Central Bank (ECB) meeting. The expectation is that the ECB will get ahead of the central-bank pack and cut its main interest rate by 25 basis points.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index near steady. Nymex crude oil prices are lower and trading around $73.25 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently around 4.3%.

Technically, August gold bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but have faded. A bearish double-top reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at the contract high of $2,477.00. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the May low of $2,308.70. First resistance is seen at $2,350.00 and then at this week’s high of $2,375.50. First support is seen at this week’s low of $2,334.80 and then at $2,325.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0.

July silver futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but are fading. A four-week-old uptrend on the daily bar chart has been negated to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the May high of $32.75. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $28.00. First resistance is seen at $30.00 and then at $30.50. Next support is seen at today’s low of $29.505 and then at $29.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.5.

67,"Jun 04, 2024",Gold will not completely replace the U.S. dollar in central bank foreign reserves - Federal Reserve Bank of New York,"(Kitco News) - The de-dollarization trend that has dominated global financial markets for nearly two years and supported gold prices at record highs is less dramatic than initially portrayed, according to a research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
In a report published last week, analysts at the regional central bank argued that while global U.S. dollar assets held by central banks have fallen 7% between 2015 and 2021, countries are not moving away from dollars en masse.

“A narrative has emerged that an observed decline in the share of dollar assets in official reserve portfolios represents the leading edge of the dollar’s loss of status in the international monetary system,” the analysts wrote. “Drawing on recent research and analytics, this post questions these narratives, arguing that these observed aggregate trends largely reflect the behavior of a small number of countries and do not represent a widespread effort by central banks to diversify away from dollars.”
The analysts said that according to their research, nearly half of the 7% decline in U.S. dollar reserves is not attributable to changes in dollar preferences.
While some countries have been actively moving away from the U.S. dollar, the New York Fed said that this trend is dominated by two countries: India and China. They noted that these two nations account for roughly 2.9 percentage points of the 7% decline.
However, the timeframe the regional central bank is using is a little dated. According to the latest Treasury data, China has sold $53.3 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries and agency bonds within the first three months of 2024
In another example, during the six years, Russia saw its foreign reserve holding grow significantly as its U.S. dollar reserves dropped, accounting for another 1.8% of the decline.
However, the analysts also noted that there were other factors behind the decline in U.S. dollar reserves.
The analysts noted that the Swiss National Bank also reduced its U.S. dollar holdings between 2015 and 2021, which accounted for 1.8% within the broader trend.
“The observed effect contributed by Switzerland is due to its accumulation of euros, largely as a result of a monetary policy framework that at times limits movements in the euro–Swiss franc pair. This contribution is, then, a story of Swiss monetary policy, and not one of a declining preference for dollar assets,” the analysts said.
The analysts said that only a handful of nations have an outright aversion to the U.S. dollar.
“The decline in the dollar preferences of a small group of countries (notably China, India, Russia, and Turkey) and the large increase in the quantity of reserves held by Switzerland explain most of the decline in the aggregate dollar share of reserves,” the analysts said. “Our research finds that the main drivers of portfolio allocations continue to be the traditional ones that stress currency pegs, proximity to the euro area in trade, and debt exposures.”
The New York Fed analysts also looked at gold’s role in the global marketplace as some countries look for U.S. dollar alternatives.
For the last two years, the gold market has seen unprecedented central bank demand. Official gold holdings increased by more than 1,000 tonnes in 2022 and 2023. In April, the World Gold Council said central bank net demand totaled 290 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024—the strongest start to any year on record.
“Gold’s seeming safety from sanctions has been widely viewed as a particularly salient factor behind official gold purchases since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the G7 countries’ subsequent decision to freeze the foreign exchange reserves of Russia’s central bank and forbid their banks from doing most business with Russian counterparts,” the central bank analysts said. “Central banks themselves have noted sanctions concerns as a driver of gold purchases and of increased vaulting of gold domestically in recent reserve manager surveys.”
Although central banks have been buying gold at an exceptional pace, the New York Fed said it does not see the trend expanding. The analysts noted that only a small number of nations are buying gold.
“While these gold purchases are certainly notable, the broader implications for central banks are limited,” the analysis said. “IMF country-level data suggest that most of the increase in official gold holdings has come from just a few central banks. More than half of reported gold accumulation since 2009 was from China and Russia, with another quarter coming from a handful of emerging market central banks (Turkey, India, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Thailand).”
The analysts also noted that gold held in reserves has its limitations.
“Gold retains important shortcomings as an alternative to fiat currencies. It bears no interest and, as a physical asset, is difficult to use in transactions, to say nothing of its high transportation, warehousing, and security costs,” the analysts said
"
68,"Jun 04, 2024","Central banks bought 36 tonnes of gold in April, sold only 3 tonnes – WGC’s Gopaul","
(Kitco News) – While gross gold purchases were similar to those seen in March, sovereign selling dried up in April, resulting in a large net gain by central banks, according to Krishan Gopaul, Senior Analyst, EMEA at the World Gold Council.
“The rapid rise in the gold price during March raised several questions,” Gopaul noted in their latest report. “One of these was whether central banks – whose demand has been posited as a key reason for the recent rally – would change their gold buying behaviour in response.”
Gopaul said that March’s more complete data, combined with initial numbers for April, show that the sovereign appetite for bullion is as strong as ever. “Latest figures – reported via the IMF and publicly available sources – show that global gold reserves rose by a net 33t in April, similar to levels seen in February (27t). Although gross purchases dipped to 36t, from 39t in March, gross sales saw a more pronounced m/m drop from 36t to just 3t in April.”
 

 
The latest numbers show that eight central banks increased their gold reserves by one tonne or more during the month. “The Central Bank of Turkey was the largest buyer, increasing its official reserves by 8t,” Gopaul said. “With 11 consecutive months of buying, the bank’s y-t-d net purchases now total 38t and lift its total official gold holdings to 578t.”
 
The other major buyers during the period were the National Bank of Kazakhstan (6t), the Reserve Bank of India (6t), the National Bank of Poland (5t), the Monetary Authority of Singapore (4t), the Central Bank of Russia (3t), and the Czech National Bank (2t).
 
Notably, the data did show a significant slowdown in gold buying by the People's Bank of China. “The bank reported that its gold reserves rose by just under 2t in April to 2,264t – the lowest monthly increase since it resumed reporting in November 2022 and well below the 18t monthly average prior to April,” he wrote.
The only significant sales in April were from the Central Banks of Uzbekistan and Jordan. “Both reported a 1t decline in their gold reserves, a notable reduction in the pace of selling seen in February and March,” Gopaul said.

March also saw significant revisions, as “net purchases for the month have been revised to just 3t following the late reporting of a 12t sale by the Central Bank of the Philippines,” Gopaul noted. “While gross purchases during March were relatively stable in the face of the rapidly rising gold price, gross sales saw a marked pick-up thanks to heavy sales from (now) four banks,” the others being Uzbekistan (11t), Thailand (10t), and Jordan (4t). 
 
“This suggests that price performance may well have had some impact on the activity of some central banks,” he said.
Gopaul said that the preliminary April data suggests that the March numbers may have been an outlier and that central banks may be continuing with their bullion accumulation plans in the face of high prices.
“Of course, more data for April, as it becomes available, as well as data for May, will be instructive to further assess how central banks’ approach to gold purchases will evolve,” Gopaul concluded. “In addition, June sees the publication of findings from our Central Bank Gold Survey 2024, which will provide a rich insight into central banks’ thinking towards gold, and how this may influence gold buying going forward.”"

72,"Jun 03, 2024",UK Snap election drives consumers to gold market - British Royal Mint,"(Kitco News) - Commodity analysts worldwide have been bullish on gold in part due to rising geopolitical uncertainty as nearly 50% of the world’s population heads to the polls.
Another country has been added to the list of more than 80 countries holding elections this year. Last month, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a snap election, with voters heading to the polls on July 4.
Analysts do not expect that the UK elections will have a significant impact on geopolitical uncertainty, driving safe-haven demand for gold; however, data from the British Royal Mint tells a slightly different story.
In a note published Monday, the Royal Mint said that bullion demand has increased since Sunak dropped the writ.
“Since the snap election was called, there has been a 49% increase in the number of customers buying precious metals bullion through The Royal Mint while the volume of gold purchases has doubled (up 117%) from the previous week. The Royal Mint’s bullion division has seen customer spending increase by 145% week-on-week while there has been a 10% uplift in first-time investors,” the mint said in a statement.
The report also noted that 49% of bullion buyers were between the ages of 44 and 59 years old. UK bullion demand appears to be bucking the broader trend, as research has shown that Generation X has the lowest interest in gold compared to older Baby Boomers and younger Millennials.
They said that physical investment products, including 1oz gold and silver Britannia coins, large gold bars, and sovereign coins, have proven to be particularly popular alongside The Royal Mint’s suite of digital products.
“The uplift in precious metals investing we have seen over the past week seems to have been driven by ‘safe-haven’ buying from investors who are attempting to mitigate the risks associated with the current uncertainty. Elections lead to increased questions around the future of the economy, tax, and security, which can cause spikes in investment activity and greater interest in precious metals,” Stuart O’Reilly, Insight Manager at the Royal Mint, said in the report. “Due to gold’s safe-haven status and lack of correlation with other assets, we tend to see surges in the buying of gold coins and bars when investors are uncertain about the future. In addition to the general election, investors are keeping a close eye on whether interest rates will come down and when that might happen, as well as looking ahead to America’s elections in November.”
UK markets have been highly sensitive to leadership turmoil in the British Parliament. Prime Minister Sunakcame to power in 2022, the third prime minister that year. He replaced Prime Minister Liz Truss, who roiled bond markets for three weeks after announcing a budget that proposed tax cuts and increased spending.
According to the latest poll, the UK Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, is expected to win by a landslide.
Some analysts have said that the UK election, while important for Western democracy, is still a sideshow to this year's main event: the U.S. Presidential election.
So far, global financial markets have taken election results in stride. The results have had a limited impact on global economic sentiment.
Some of the highlights so far this year include Vladimir Putin’s landslide victory to a fifth term as President of Russia. The government said Putin won 87.28% of the vote and that turnout was the highest in history, at 74% of the electorate. However, the elections were widely condemned by the West as neither free nor fair.
In January, Taiwan elected Lai Ching-te president, leading the pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to a historic third term in power, which angered Beijing. Since the election, China has taken a renewed hard line on Taiwan’s independence, adding to geopolitical uncertainty in Asia.
India has just wrapped up its weeks-long election, and while the ballots are still being counted, exit polls predict that Narendra Modi will remain the nation’s Prime Minister."
73,"Jun 03, 2024","India repatriates over 100 tonnes of gold from BoE to RBI vaults, amount could double in coming months","
(Kitco News) – Over 100 tonnes of gold have been moved from the United Kingdom to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) vaults in one of the most ambitious transfers of the precious metal ever undertaken, and that amount could double in the coming months, according to a report from the Times of India published Friday.
Up until now, over half of the RBI’s gold reserves were being held with the Bank of England (BoE) and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) overseas, but the Indian government has begun the process of repatriating the country’s bullion holdings.
As of March 31, 2024, the RBI’s total gold reserves were listed at 822.1 tonnes, up from 794.63 tonnes in March of 2023, and 413.8 tonnes of that total was held overseas.
The Bank of England has long served as the storehouse for the bullion reserves of a large number of central banks, including those of India, with some of the country’s gold reserves housed in the UK since before Independence in 1947.
An unnamed Indian government official was quoted as saying that the decision was taken in part to cut back on the storage fees the RBI was paying to the BoE on the reserves, which have risen as the value of the bullion has appreciated to all-time high prices this year.
“RBI started purchasing gold a few years ago and decided to undertake a review of where it wants to store it, something that is done from time to time,” the official said. “Since stock was building up overseas, it was decided to get some of the gold to India.”
The secure movement of nearly $8.3 billion in heavy gold bars was a massive logistical undertaking, involving months of planning followed by careful execution with close coordination between the finance ministry, the RBI, and several other national and local government departments.
The RBI also needed to get a national customs duty exemption to ‘import’ the precious metal, as the bullion constituted a sovereign asset. There was no exemption from the goods and services tax on the gold, however, because this tax revenue is shared with the states.
The government also made use of specialized aircraft to transport the massive gold shipments, with the highest levels of security arrangements.
The 100 tonnes of gold has now joined the balance of India’s domestically-held gold reserves in the old RBI vaults on Mumbai’s Mint Road as well as the new state-of-the-art vaults located in the new RBI building in Nagpur.
“While no one was watching, RBI has shifted 100 tonnes of its gold reserves back to India from UK,” prominent economist Sanjeev Sanyal told India Today. “India will now hold most of its gold in its own vaults. We have come a long way since we had to ship out gold overnight in 1991 in the midst of a crisis.”
In 1991, Indian Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar was facing a severe balance of payments crisis after which it pledged to raise funds. Between July 4 and 18, 1991, the RBI was forced to sell 46.91 tonnes of gold to the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, raising $400 million in the process.
Then, in 2009, India’s central bank purchased 200 tonnes of gold worth $6.7 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
According to the latest World Gold Council data, India’s sovereign gold reserves place it ninth in the world, just behind Japan, and the precious metal represents nearly 9% of its total foreign currency reserves, nearly double China’s 4.64%.

74,"Jun 03, 2024",The Costco gold standard - retailer sparks notable shift in retail purchasing behavior,"(Kitco News) - Costco continues to see an insatiable appetite for physical gold and silver, which is helping to transform the marketplace.
Last week, the North American retailer published its third quarter results for the fiscal year, announcing a 9.1% increase in net sales to $57.39 billion, up from $52.60 billion last year.
At the same time, the company said it saw a 20.7% jump in online sales.
""Total e-commerce sales growth in the quarter was led by gold and silver bullions, gift cards and appliances,"" Costco Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip told investors Thursday in a conference call.
Millerchip provided no further insights into its gold and silver bullion sales. However, Costco’s precious metals strategy appears to be evolving in line with analyst expectations.
In a report published in April,  analysts at Wells Fargo speculated that Costco’s gold bullion sales would drive earnings growth, as the company has made headlines worldwide.
The equity analysts said they estimate Costco is selling $100 to $200 million in bullion every month.
The analysts also noted that while bullion sales are helping to drive online sales, they are probably not adding much to the company’s bottom line.
“The company prices the product attractively, providing members gold at ~2% above spot prices before a 2% cash back reward for executive members and another 2% in cash back for those with the Citi card. That being said, pricing at that level and shipping costs suggests it’s a very low-profit business at best,” the analysts said.
Some analysts have said that Costco’s gold sales are not surprising as stubborn inflation is prompting many retail consumers to find ways to protect their purchasing power.
Others have said that the Costco phenomenon could be a new defining moment for the gold market. In a commentary published late April, Nicky Shiels, Head of Research & Metals Strategy at MKS PAMP, questioned whether Costco sales could lead to the same kind of demand created when gold-backed exchange-traded funds were introduced.
""The Costco Gold & subsequent media boom has already punched above its raw (fundamental) weight in influencing opinion; it alone is putting Gold as an asset class back on the map for new (that's the key word here) retail investors,"" she said in the commentary. ""Game-changing market moments come'n go. Some are just well-timed, coincidentally, or not. GLD was developed a couple of years after 9/11 and at the start of zero interest rates, easily creating a bigger path for investors to access the metal. Costco has done more for sentiment and opening new channels when trust has completely broken down post-COVID.""
However, Sheils concluded that Costco’s gold sales are just one part of a broadening landscape."
75,"Jun 03, 2024","ECB-Fed divergence could muddy gold price forecasts, solar drives record-high silver premiums in China – Heraeus","
(Kitco News) – The expected ECB-Fed divergence will complicate things for gold investors, while solar demand is driving silver premiums in China to record highs, according to precious metals strategists at Heraeus.
In their latest precious metals report, the analysts noted that despite a down week, gold prices have still managed to stay above $2,300 per ounce. “Friday’s US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index of 2.7% reinforced the message that the Fed’s first rate cut may arrive later than other major economies, most notably in the EU,” they said.
Heraeus sees the ECB cutting rates ahead of the Fed as a potential positive for European bullion investors. “The Eurozone maintained relatively cool inflation of 2.4% in April, an environment possibly enabling monetary easing for the ECB sooner rather than later,” they wrote. “The market has already started to price in an ECB rate cut at its meeting on 6 June. If effected, the increasing differential between the US and EU’s interest rates could weaken the euro, especially if the Fed delays a rate cut on its side.”
The analysts see both good and bad outcomes for gold prices as a result of the central banks’ divergence. “A stronger dollar diminishes foreign investors’ purchasing power, but a lower-rate environment could strengthen gold’s appeal to those buying gold in euros as a non-yielding asset, as an inflation and currency devaluation hedge,” they said. “Meanwhile, a weaker euro could spell greater relative upside for gold in euro terms versus the benchmark dollar price.”
Gold is seeing a strong start to the week, with spot gold last trading at $2,339.11 per ounce, up 0.51% on the session at the time of writing.

Turning to silver, the analysts said that retail investor sentiment towards the gray metal has been mixed so far this year, and they pointed out another divergence, this one in the coin market.
“A stark difference has emerged between sales of silver coins from the US Mint and bullion products from the Perth Mint in Australia,” they wrote. “Year-to-date, sales from the US have totalled 10.8 moz (up 4.15 moz year-on-year). Meanwhile, Perth Mint sales have fallen by 49% year-on-year to 3.21 moz in the first four months of 2024. Perth Mint coins have historically been popular in the German market, and it is possible that the changes to German VAT laws in 2023 continue to crimp demand for foreign bullion coins.”

“If sales from the US Mint continue at the same pace as at the start of the year, sales could exceed 32 moz this year which would be the highest since 2016,” they said.
Silver prices also maintained their recent high range above $30 per ounce despite last week’s losses, and regional price disparities have also widened. “Demand from robust solar PV production – now on course to exceed last year’s record – is set to maintain high silver import demand into China,” Heraeus said. “The trend is reflected by the high premium in China’s silver market. In April, the monthly spread between Shanghai and London’s silver spot price reached a highest-ever $3.69/oz. The increasing arbitrage could also encourage more metal flows into China and further tighten supply elsewhere.”

Silver is seeing a weaker start to the week, with spot silver last trading at $30.325 at the time of writing for a loss of 0.18% on the daily chart.

77,"Jun 03, 2024",Correction: Gold prices jump as U.S. ISM manufacturing falls to 48.7 ,"Editor's Note: There was an error in the headline. The article has been corrected to reflect the accurate reading in the ISM PMI.
(Kitco News) - The gold market has renewed momentum, holding sold gains above $2,350 an ounce, as the U.S. manufacturing sector loses more momentum, falling deeper into contraction territory. .
On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its manufacturing index dropped to 48.7% in May, compared to April’s reading of 49.2%. The data was weaker than expected, as consensus forecasts looked for a slight improvement to 49.8.
“U.S. manufacturing activity continued in contraction after growing in March, the first expansion for the sector since September 2022. Demand was soft again, output was stable, and inputs stayed accommodative,” said Timothy Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee.
Readings above 50% in such diffusion indexes signify economic growth and vice-versa. The farther an indicator is above or below 50%, the greater or smaller the rate of change.
The gold market was already seeing some initial buying momentum as it was bouncing off its overnight lows; however, the disappointing economic data has created a new bid in the marketplace.
August gold futures last traded at $2,359 an ounce, up 0.60% on the day.
Analysts note that gold is rallying as U.S. bond yields start to fall. There are growing market expectations that a slowing economy would force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates even as inflation remains relatively elevated.
Markets see an 82% chance of a rate cut in November. Analysts have said that the U.S. economy is facing a growing threat of stagflation as activity slows but inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Commodity analysts have said that this would be a strong environment for gold.
While the headline number disappointed, the components of the report were relatively mixed. The New Orders Index dropped to 45.4% last month, down from the prior reading of 49.1. At the same time the Shipments Index dropped to 50.2%, down from 5.13%.
However, the sector’s labor market saw improved activity, rising to 51.1% from 48.6% in April.
Inflation pressures also eased slightly with the Prices Index falling to 57%, down from the previous reading of 60.9%. "

80,"May 31, 2024",Gold dips as traders digest April PCE price index data,"Gold futures for the August 2024 contract, now the most actively traded, experienced a double-digit decline on the last trading day of May. In New York, the August contract closed at $2,345.60 per troy ounce, down $20.70 or 0.81%. This daily drop contributed to a weekly decline of $11.10 or 0.47%. However, gold still managed to eke out a monthly gain of $21.10 or 0.91% in May.

Market participants are now interpreting the latest inflation data from the April Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index report released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The report revealed a $65.3 billion increase in personal income, a $40.2 billion rise in disposable personal income (DPI), and a $39.1 billion or 0.2% increase in personal consumption expenditures (PCE).
According to the BEA, ""The PCE price index increased 0.3 percent. Excluding food and energy, the PCE price index increased 0.2 percent. Real DPI decreased 0.1 percent in April, and real PCE decreased 0.1 percent; goods decreased 0.4 percent, and services increased 0.1 percent.""
The report confirmed earlier estimates by MarketWatch and Reuters, predicting that inflation in April would increase by 2.7% year-over-year, still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. However, this is the first month in 2024 that inflationary pressures have remained steady rather than accelerating from the previous month.
The latest data has increased the probability of a rate cut by the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. According to the CME's FedWatch tool, the probability of a rate cut by September has risen from 50.5% yesterday to 53.2% today. The likelihood of a 0.25% rate cut increased from 45.1% to 46.6%, while the chances of a 0.5% cut rose from 5.4% to 6.6%.
On a technical basis the August contract of gold futures did close below its 50-day simple moving average. Market technicians will watch closely to see if there is a deeper decline below this critical level or if gold pricing manages to move back above.
Lower interest rates tend to benefit gold prices in the long run, as gold does not yield interest, and higher rates typically weigh on the precious metal's appeal. Despite the recent dip in gold prices, the metal managed to close out May with a nearly 1% gain, benefiting from the prospect of easier monetary policy ahead.

81,"May 31, 2024",Market experts and retail traders align once again with a majority predicting gold price recovery,"
(Kitco News) – While gold prices did manage to move higher during the first half of the shortened Memorial Day week, the days were mostly characterized by a march toward Friday’s PCE report, with precious metals investors looking to the Fed’s preferred inflation metric to gauge the likely path of interest rates, and the prospects for further gains for gold. 
After opening the week trading at $2,334 per ounce, spot gold managed to hit a high just a couple of dollars short of $2,360 during Monday's Memorial Day holiday, but it failed to hold above $2,350 during the evening session. The return of American markets the following morning brought renewed enthusiasm for the precious metal, driving it to the weekly high of $2,361.45 by noon Tuesday. But once again, the bulls ran out of momentum and overnight trading saw the price fall precipitously, which began gold's steady decline to a new weekly low of $2,325.06 early Thursday morning. 
The precious metal bounced hard off this level, however, and by the start of Thursday's North American session, gold was once again within a dollar of $2,350 per ounce. Thereafter began the wait for Friday morning’s PCE report, which brought renewed drama to precious metals markets, driving gold from $2,344 per ounce a half hour before the 8:30 am release to its daily high of $2,359.72 15 minutes afterward.
But as had been the case on Monday and Tuesday, the bulls once again ran themselves to exhaustion, and gold prices fell all the way to a fresh weekly low of $2,320.59 per ounce shortly after 3:00 pm EDT. 

The latest Kitco News Weekly Gold Survey has industry experts and retail traders aligned on gold’s near-term prospects, with a majority seeing gains while equal minorities hold a neutral or negative position.
“I’m sticking with up for this week as sellers had an open door to force a breakdown and they haven’t been able to,” said James Stanley, senior market strategist at Forex.com. “The weekly bar in spot Gold is showing as a doji and there remains a lot of support structure underneath current price, and that’s what sellers were unable to drive through this week. And gold futures finished with a bearish engulf in the prior week and that similarly failed to show follow-through.”
“We could be nearing a turn,” Stanley added, “but until that support structure is violated, I’m going to bias with what’s been the dominant trend.”
“Up,” said Adrian Day, President of Adrian Day Asset Management. “Gold still has further to go in its recovery from the mid-month drop, and somewhat cooler inflation numbers in the U.S. will help support the case for the Federal Reserve to cut rates.”
Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said he’s adopting a neutral stance for next week. “Rangebound for now, with risk slightly skewed to the upside,” he said.
“Down,” said Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst at Barchart.com. “While the more active August futures contract has technically completed its 3-wave short-term downtrend, it is not showing a bullish reversal pattern through early Friday morning. This leaves the door open to continued pressure early next week. However, technical analysis has to come with an asterisk given the increased chance of chaos tied to China and Russia this coming weekend. As a safe-haven market, this could spark new buying in gold markets ahead of Friday’s close.”
Sean Lusk, co-director of commercial hedging at Walsh Trading, was unpacking the different factors that led to the gold price decline on Friday.
“I’m bullish still… I’m a little surprised,” he said about the pullback. “We're at month-end here, so how much of this is just some unwinding? You had a lot of longs in the June contract, so I understand that, prior to option expiration and first notice, you've had a retreat in price. That wasn't a surprise, it was expected.”
“I think interest rates for near term here may have topped, and I think if you have that, you're going to pressure the dollar, and maybe [gold prices] start to work back higher,” Lusk said. “However, Chinese manufacturing came out weak, which hit copper. Some of the industrial metals have given back here, but silver's still holding $30 on the break.”
“I just feel that these breaks are eventually going to be buying opportunities across the board,” he added, looking at the commodities complex as a whole. “You just can't get any traction in crude oil. And there's some real worry about the equities. They've come off here quite a bit, particularly the Dow Jones hitting over 40,000, we just broke 2000 points. NASDAQ has just gotten whacked here. So I don't know… if this starts to leg lower in the equities, does it pull everything else with it? That's the issue.”
“All this talk of raising rates, let's just throw that out,” Lusk said. “I think we go back to more of the buy-the-dips mentality here in commodities overall. Bond yields are going to start to come off here a little bit, I think the tops are in. I just think that with housing, pending home sales, nothing's moving, and I don't see that getting any better until rates come down a little bit. They're going to bring the talk back to rate cuts rather than rate hikes, which is really what turned the stock market around recently.”
“We're going to get another whole slew of data here,” Lusk added. “I think we're going to have a shift change in sentiment coming soon, given the fact that maybe yields have topped, and futures are going to get a lift, and that's going to put pressure on the dollar where rallies are sold in the dollar.”
This week, 10 Wall Street analysts participated in the Kitco News Gold Survey, and a solid majority have returned to the bullish camp with six experts, representing 60%, expecting to see gold prices climb higher next week. Two analysts, or 20%, predicted a price decline, and the same number see gold trending sideways as it waits for direction during the coming week.
Meanwhile, 222 votes were cast in Kitco’s online poll, with Main Street investors mirroring expert sentiment this week. 128 retail traders, or 58%, look for gold prices to rise next week. Another 53, or 24%, expect they will be lower, while 41 respondents, representing the remaining 18%, expect prices to remain rangebound during the week ahead.

Next week promises a return to a more normal rhythm of economic news releases. On Monday, markets will receive the S&P global manufacturing PMI and the ISM manufacturing PMI for May. Then on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada will announce its interest rate decision, with economists predicting a quarter-point cut, and shortly afterward, markets will receive the ISM services PMI for May.
Thursday morning brings the ECB interest rate decision, with markets priced in for a 25 basis point cut to the benchmark interest rate, along with weekly jobless claims. And Friday morning, markets will await the release of May's nonfarm payrolls report.
“The week ahead features possible rate cuts by the ECB and the Bank of Canada, and US jobs data,” said Marc Chandler, Managing Director at Bannockburn Global Forex. “Spot gold consolidated between roughly $2322 and $2364 last week. Still, it has advanced in five of the last six sessions.  The momentum indicators look poised to turn higher.”
“I like it higher,” Chandler said. “A move above $2372 could signal a retest on $2400.”
Everett Millman, Chief Market Analyst at Gainesville Coins, was looking past this week’s near-term volatility to the medium-term drivers that are likely to dominate gold’s price action between now and the fall.
“I definitely agree that the end-of-month volatility we're seeing is typical,” he said. “That's more of a trading dynamic than anything else, so I don't think it speaks very strongly to what's driving the gold market overall.”
“It is true that the summer season is usually quite bad for gold,” Millman said. “Those are the dog days of summer where typically we expect to see gold prices, at minimum trade sideways, if not drift lower. But that's under normal circumstances. I think that much of what gold has done this year bucks the normal trend on every front. The Fed has been consistently hawkish and rate cut expectations seem to be fluctuating. They definitely have been volatile in their own right. So I think it's difficult to point toward a direct line between Fed expectations and what gold is doing.”
Millman said his general take is that gold is responding to the uncertainty surrounding the rate path itself, rather than any sense of what that path might be.
“If we go from 70 percent expectation of a September rate cut to 30 percent, back and forth, it speaks to the fact that the market still doesn't have a strong hold on what it expects the Fed to do,” he said. “I think that will be the big story over the summer. How do the Fed rate cut expectations change between now and when we get closer to September? I don't think anybody really knows. You could make a pretty compelling argument that even the FOMC members don't seem to know exactly where things are going to go.”
Millman said that in the absence of anything else changing, the gold market will continue to try to read the collective mind of the Fed. “Obviously, all of the macro geopolitical factors are still there, but I think gold has mostly baked in all of that stuff, he said. “That's why we're still sitting above $2,300 now.”
“Fed policy, and how the economy holds up, I think, is going to be the big driver over the summer for gold.”
“Bull,” said Mark Leibovit, publisher of the VR Metals/Resource Letter. “Hanging in there.”
“We are likely in higher timeframe bearish correction against the move up from 19001,” said Michael Moor, Founder of Moor Analytics. “The trade below 24343 (+1.3 tics per/hour) has brought in $113.5 of pressure. These roll into the (Q) and are ON HOLD. In (Q) we are currently holding exhaustion warned about at 23447 with a 23433 low and have rallied $30.4. The trade above 23594 (-6 per/hour) now warns of decent strength. Decent trade back below where this comes in at 23452 (-6 tics per/hour starting at 9:20 am EST) will warn of decent pressure and take bear calls OFF HOLD.”
And Kitco Senior Analyst Jim Wyckoff sees gold prices staging a recovery next week. “Steady-higher as charts still bullish,” he said.
Spot gold last traded at $2,327.20 per ounce at the time of writing, down 0.69% on the day and down 0.29% on the week.

82,"May 31, 2024",Technical silver breakout confirmed as stagflation fears mount,"Silver prices have surged to their highest levels since December 2012, driven by robust industrial demand and expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Following a March technically confirmed breakout in gold with a monthly basis close above critical 13-year resistance at $2100, the silver price ended May trading on the COMEX this morning above major 12-year resistance at $30.
With the trend being solidly to the upside as silver continues to lead gold higher, this is classic precious metals bull market action. After a monthly close above stiff multi-year resistance at $30 silver this week, the expectation is that both gold and silver could rise further, with periods of backing and filling, as both have now broken through major multi-year technical resistance levels.  
Gold is proving its role of maintaining purchasing power during periods of economic and political uncertainty and social upheaval. Geopolitical concerns, a growing sovereign debt crisis, and evidence of stagflation setting in have been the principal drivers for gold, and now silver, entering a new bull market.
Inflation is still a problem by remaining well above the Fed’s 2% target, while the economy is slowing well below 2% growth and that spells stagflation. Yet again, the Fed has missed the mark on stagflation as they did in the early 1970s. Back in early 2022, the Fed believed inflation would be “transitory,” and that the economy would come down for a “soft landing.” 
By the end of 2023, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell believed the U.S. economy would enter the year with lower prices and see numerous cuts due to waning inflation coming closer to the central bank's fictional 2% target. Despite Powell still claiming not to see either 'the stag' or ‘the flation’, recent economic data points to the U.S. economy slowing, while inflation remains sticky. 
More evidence of stagflation coming into the U.S. economy was presented this week, along with several weak bond auctions, pressuring stocks and bonds lower while gold and silver remain in strong uptrends. 
Stocks and bonds continued their recent decline after another round of lackluster treasury auctions this week created more angst for investors. Concerns over funding the U.S. deficit means that yields will have to rise. 
After this week’s bond auctions failed to produce the demand needed, bond yields climbed to their highest levels in over a month leaving the Fed and the economy in a box. Fed-speak teases investors about lower rates, but the central bank cannot commit. The economic data does not support a rate cut, but Fed-heads are trying desperately to send the message that rate cuts are coming.
The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis announced on Thursday that the preliminary reading of Q1 GDP showed that the economy grew 1.3% in the first three months of the new year, lower than the advance reading of 1.6% and down from 3.4% reported in the fourth quarter.
The report also noted mixed consumption data as consumers dip further into their savings and credit. The report said that personal income increased 0.3% last month, in line with expectations and down from the 0.5% reported in March.
The hike in the federal funds rate to a 23-year high between 5.25% and 5.50% has increased the cost of credit across the board, making it more expensive for consumers to take out debt. The cumulative amount of debt held by Americans totaled $17.69 trillion in the first quarter, with $1.12 trillion of that being on credit cards with an over 20% interest rate. 
The share of people who were behind 90 days or more on their credit card payments in the quarter jumped to 10.7%, outdoing the pandemic high of 10% in the first quarter of 2021.
The lower-than-expected GDP data was followed by the U.S. Department of Commerce announcing this morning that its core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% in April.
Furthermore, hopes for a stabilizing U.S. housing market were dealt a severe blow this week after the number of potential home buyers collapsed in April. The U.S. pending home sales index dropped 7.7% in April, after March’s upwardly revised 3.6% rise. The data was much worse than forecasts, as economists were expecting to see only a 0.6% decline. 
For the year, pending home sales fell -7.4% against expectations for a 0.5% increase, and after moving into positive territory with a 0.1% print in March. All four U.S. regions registered month-over-month and year-over-year declines, while home prices will rise a bit faster this year than previously expected due to limited available supply, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
A major factor that is never included in the inflation numbers is rising taxation. Government claims that taxes are the citizens’ obligation and not part of our cost of living. Joe Biden and his administration would like to implement a draconian 44.6% tax on capital gains, the highest tax on capital gains in the nation’s history.
Washington says the added tax is necessary to address the looming national debt, while government simultaneously implements measures to ensure that the nation falls deeper into debt. Perpetually issuing new debt to pay for the old is equivalent to a Ponzi scheme that will eventually fail. Read the full Biden administration Fiscal Year 2025 tax proposal here.
Trade wars have also ramped up recently, particularly between the U.S. and China, which is also inflationary. Interest payments on the debt are through the roof, while 70% of the nearly $35 trillion federal debt is accumulative interest. But in a crisis, the Fed can only print more money to pay off old maturing debt with new debt. 
Numerous banks are in trouble and more collapses are expected, with commercial real estate being more susceptible to crisis during a higher-for-longer interest rate climate.
With the U.S. having trouble financing its debt, there remains risk of a sovereign debt crisis. As conflict between the U.S. and China heightens, China is on a clear path to unload its holdings of U.S. treasuries. China has already sold a record amount of Treasury and U.S. agency bonds in the first quarter, highlighting the Asian nation’s move to exit the U.S. debt market while using the proceeds to buy more gold. 
The share of physical bullion in China's reserves climbed to 4.9% in April, the highest level recorded since central bank data collection began in 2015. Beijing dumped a total of US$53.3 billion of Treasuries and agency bonds combined in the first quarter, based on Bloomberg calculations of the latest data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Belgium, often seen as a custodian of China’s holdings, disposed of US$22 billion of Treasuries during the period.
Meanwhile, silver has recently been leading the gold price with an impressive gain of over 45% since bottoming in February at $22, and silver juniors continue to lead both gold and its miners. After being hated and ignored since peaking in mid-2020, many quality issues have finally begun to move higher with the silver price. 
With the market cap of the entire silver mining sector being just $15 billion, we could see significant upside in the long-forgotten silver space into summer. Especially now that silver has technically broken out above multi-year stiff resistance at $30. 
With silver still being mostly ignored by investors for the past several years, the silver equity complex may be the best trade right now and the one to watch going forward. 
After the silver price broke out above multi-year resistance at $30 on a monthly closing basis in May, the metal appears to be on the verge of a major up-leg from a huge 4-year base. The last time silver prices broke above $30 per ounce in 2011, the precious metal went onto trade at $50 in the space of 100 days. 
In anticipation of the incredible gains the junior sector will begin to experience now that the silver price has printed a technical breakout above $30 on a monthly closing basis, the Junior Miner Junky (JMJ) newsletter accumulated a basket of quality silver and gold juniors with 3x-10x upside potential into 2025-26.

83,"May 31, 2024",Commodity Supercycle: What It Means for Metals - Bill Baruch,"(Kitco News) - The commodity market is on the cusp of a massive shift, driven by an emerging supercycle that is pushing prices to new heights. Bill Baruch, President of Blue Line Futures, spoke with Kitco News Anchor Jeremy Szafron about the significant demand that arose in the wake of the pandemic, which has since been compounded by geopolitical issues and supply chain disruptions.
Commodity supercycles have occurred before, notably in the 1970s and 2000s, driven by massive global demand and constrained supply. As of May 27, 2024, prices for key commodities like gold and silver have surged, with silver recently surpassing $30 per ounce. This marks a significant technical breakout, indicating potential for further gains. A technical breakout occurs when a commodity's price moves above a key resistance level, suggesting a continuation of the current trend. ""As long as it stays above $30, the path of least resistance remains higher to $35, $40, $50, and maybe more,"" Baruch explained.

Silver's Rise and Technical Breakout
Silver's rise constitutes a critical technical breakout, setting the stage for potential gains.  ""Silver moving above $30 is a significant achievement,"" Baruch said. ""If it holds above this level, we could see it building a base to target $35, and potentially move towards $50 or even $70.""
Historically, silver is no stranger to these kinds of breakouts. In the late 1970s, driven by inflation and geopolitical instability, silver prices skyrocketed to nearly $50 per ounce. More recently, the 2011 surge saw silver briefly touch $49. Silver's price action has often been volatile, influenced by industrial demand and speculative trading.
Broader Commodity Supercycle
Baruch suggested we are witnessing a broader commodity supercycle that will impact various sectors. ""It's not just gold and silver and copper. Look at cocoa and the moves in coffee and other commodities,"" he said. ""The demand coming out of the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical issues are all driving this supercycle."" Cocoa prices, for example, have soared due to supply shortages in West Africa, while coffee prices have risen amid adverse weather conditions in Brazil.
Copper, essential for electronics and renewable energy technologies, has also seen significant price increases. As of May 2024, copper prices are near all-time highs, driven by robust demand from electric vehicle production and infrastructure projects. This aligns with Baruch's observation that commodities are benefiting from industrial demand and geopolitical factors.
Managing Market Risks
Baruch stressed the importance of managing risks in this volatile market. ""There are always going to be surprises,"" he warned, highlighting the need for technical analysis and strategic trading to navigate potential pitfalls. ""We work with a wide range of clients. Some people just want to have silver exposure. And if that's you out there with silver exposure, that's where you're looking at it staying above $30 in the near term. Others want to trade it. What I'm doing a Blue Creek Capital, my commodity fund, is trying to manage my downside here and capture all the upside. And I'm more active in trading this.""
Mexico and Peru have seen significant disruptions in silver production due to labor strikes and regulatory changes. These disruptions have exacerbated supply constraints, further supporting higher silver prices. Managing such risks involves staying informed about local developments and using tools like stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses.
Looking ahead, Baruch remained optimistic about the potential for commodities to continue their upward trajectory. ""This is a commodity supercycle,"" he asserted. ""The current market conditions could lead to sustained higher prices across various commodities. Given the demand, we could see silver moving to $35, $40, $50, and with growing interest, even $70 isn't off the table.""

84,"May 31, 2024",Are U.S. debt markets overshadowing the broader economy? - Ted Oakley,"(Kitco News) - The U.S. economy is grappling with an escalating debt crisis, raising concerns about the sustainability of growth and its economic health. As the government borrows heavily to fund various initiatives, it raises questions about the long-term impacts on the nation's financial stability.
According to Ted Oakley, Managing Partner and Founder of Oxbow Advisors, the excessive focus on government debt might be crowding out other critical areas of the economy. ""You do get in a situation after a while where you're using so much of the money you create in the country to buy your own bonds,"" he told Kitco News Anchor Jeremy Szafron. Oakley predicts significant challenges within the next five years unless decisive actions are taken.

GDP Growth: An Inflation Illusion?
The reported GDP growth has been a contentious topic, with Oakley suggesting that current figures may not accurately reflect the economic reality for many Americans. ""A lot of GDP right now comes from inflation,"" he stated, pointing out that rising prices inflate GDP figures without the corresponding real economic growth. 
The GDP growth figures have been misleading, as they often fail to account for the inflation that inflates these numbers. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, GDP growth was reported at a rate 25% higher than initially forecasted, but much of this growth was attributed to inflation rather than real economic progress.
This disconnect between GDP figures and actual economic conditions is evident in consumers' struggles. Over half of the U.S. population is currently facing financial hardship, struggling to meet basic expenses amid soaring costs. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) has risen significantly, impacting household budgets and contributing to a widening economic disparity.
Fed Rate Cuts: Temporary Relief?
The Federal Reserve's actions on interest rates are closely watched by investors and economists alike. The current federal funds rate stands at 5.5%, and there is speculation about potential cuts as the election approaches. However, Oakley cautions that these cuts might provide only short-term relief. ""If the Fed funds rate is five and a half, how many times do you think they'll cut before election time? My guess is if they did anything, it would be one... As a trade, that doesn't make any sense to us,"" he remarked, suggesting that any market response to rate cuts could be fleeting.
Inflation continues to be a pressing issue, with the latest CPI data indicating persistent upward pressure on prices. This inflationary environment complicates the Fed's decisions, balancing the need to control inflation with the desire to stimulate economic growth.
Market Dynamics and Consumer Debt
Market volatility has been another defining feature of 2024, with significant gains in the indexes driven primarily by a few key stocks, notably the ""Magnificent Seven""—Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia. Nvidia, in particular, has shown remarkable performance, reporting a first-quarter revenue of $26.04 billion, up 262% from the previous year.
Consumer debt and delinquencies are also on the rise, adding another layer of concern. Credit card delinquency rates have surged, and auto loan delinquencies have reached troubling levels, exacerbated by high interest rates and economic uncertainty. These trends reflect broader financial strains among consumers, who are grappling with high costs and low wage growth.

86,"May 31, 2024",Gold sees price gains after as-expected U.S. inflation data,"(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are modestly higher in early U.S. trading Friday, in a relief rally following a key U.S. inflation report that came in very close to market expectations and is not considered hot. August gold was last up $7.20 at $2,373.80. July silver was last up $0.116 at $31.645.
The U.S. data point of the day, if not the holiday-shortened week, saw Friday morning’s personal income and outlays report for April, including its inflation indexes that are very closely watched by the Federal Reserve, come in close to market expectations on the inflation data. The PCE price index for April was up 2.7%, year-on-year, which is right in line with market expectations. The PCE price index for March was also up 2.7%. The April core PCE price index came in up 2.8%, year-on-year and was forecast at up 2.7% and compares to a rise of 2.8% rise in the March report.
Asian and European stock indexes were mixed overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward modestly higher openings when the New York day session begins.
In overnight news, some downbeat China manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) data was released. China’s official manufacturing PMI fell to 49.5 in May. A reading below 50.0 suggests contraction in the sector. The services PMI came in at 51.1 in May. The composite PMI fell to 51.0 in May from 51.7 in April.
The Eurozone May consumer price index came in at up 2.6%, which was slightly higher than expected and compares with the April reading of up 2.4%. The core CPI in May was up 2.9%, year-on-year.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index lower. Nymex crude oil prices are near steady and trading around $78.00 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently 4.508%.
Other U.S. economic data due for release Friday includes the Chicago ISM business survey.

Technically, August gold bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but have faded. A bearish double-top reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at the contract high of $2,477.00. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the May low of $2,308.70. First resistance is seen at this week’s high of $2,388.00 and then at $2,400.00. First support is seen at $2,350.00 and then at this week’s low of $2,343.30. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0.

July silver futures bulls have the solid overall near-term technical advantage. Prices are in a four-week-old uptrend on the daily bar chart. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the May high of $32.75. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $29.00. First resistance is seen at $32.00 and then at $32.28. Next support is seen at the overnight low of $30.94 and then at $30.50. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 7.0.

Currently, gold futures have resumed trading in Australia fixing the August contract at $2364.40 a $2.10 decline from the closing price in New York. Gains today were greatly aided by a weaker U.S. dollar and a yield decline in U.S. Treasuries. The dollar declined by 0.36% taking the index to 104.78.Market participants are intently focused on the upcoming PCE price index report which will be released on Friday. The PCE price index is the preferred inflation metric used by the Federal Reserve which means the numbers revealed tomorrow could yield insight about the timing and magnitude of rate cuts this year. This week gold investors and traders have faced strong headwinds created by exceedingly hawkish statements by some Federal Reserve officials.
Current estimates according to MarketWatch are anticipating that inflation will show a year-over-year increase of 2.7%. If this forecast is correct, it would mean that inflation in April remained unchanged month over month when compared to March. That being said, this level of inflation is still well above the Fed’s 2% target.
Jim Wyckoff, Kitco's senior analyst, attributed the modest gains to ""a little bit of bargain hunting after the dip in prices."" He noted that the weaker dollar, lower yields, and recent stock market sell-off have provided bullish tailwinds for precious metals.
Additionally, the latest GDP figures revealed a slower economic growth rate in the United States for the first quarter than initially estimated.

89,"May 30, 2024",Silver supply/demand imbalance amid energy transition means ‘much higher prices for silver bullion and equities’ – Sprott CIO Smirnova,"
(Kitco News) – While the global energy transition requires critical materials such as cobalt, lithium and nickel, silver plays a key role across a range of clean energy technologies, and the market is reflecting this reality, according to Maria Smirnova, Managing partner at Sprott and Chief Investment Officer at Sprott Asset Management.
“Following a year of flat performance (silver gained 0.66% in 2023), thus far in 2024, silver has staged a strong rally, climbing 32.93% as of this writing (YTD through 5/27/2024),” Smirnova wrote in Sprott’s latest silver report. “Silver has been playing catch up to gold's rally, with both metals buoyed by the prospect of easing monetary policy in the U.S., rising geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East and central bank buying, particularly from China. Silver faced several headwinds in 2023, most notably rising interest rates and slower economic growth in both the U.S. and China.”
Smirnova noted that despite a robust physical silver market in 2023, Western investment demand was weak, as evidenced by silver ETFs selling 50 million ounces over the year, or 6% of total holdings. “Looking ahead, we expect silver prices to continue to improve, driven by lower interest rates, more robust physical investment, ETF purchases and increased industrial demand,” she said.

“For the third year, silver demand significantly exceeded supply in 2023 as demand for industrial applications continued to increase,” Smirnova said. “Much of this growth has been driven by photovoltaics, and overall, industrial demand is forecast to rise by 9% this year to a new record high.”
Smirnova added that this dynamic will support silver miners even as it boosts the gray metal’s market price.

Smirnova pointed out a fundamental shift in demand for silver, which she believes is likely to continue.
“Historically, half of the demand for silver has been industrial, and the remaining half has included investment and investment-like categories such as jewelry, silverware, and actual bar and coin investment,” she wrote. “In recent years, however, the balance has been shifting in favor of industrial demand, which now represents 55% of the total demand for silver,” which would represent “an 11% jump from 2022.”

Sprott sees three major areas for growth in industrial demand for silver in the coming years: The solar energy industry, the automotive sector, including electric vehicles (EV) and their associated infrastructure, and artificial intelligence (AI).

Smirnova said that the solar energy and photovoltaics sector is absorbing 40% of global investment in energy transition manufacturing, “reaching $80 billion in 2023,” and Sprott believes solar demand for silver will “continue to increase, possibly by 170% by 2030.”
Already, solar has nearly tripled its share of silver demand in the last 10 years. “In 2023, photovoltaics consumed 142 million ounces of silver, or 13.8% of total silver usage worldwide, up from nearly 5% in 2014,” she wrote.
And even as manufacturers work to reduce the quantity of silver required in solar panels, the massive scaling up in panel production should see overall silver demand from the sector continue to increase at a strong rate. “According to BloombergNEF, the global solar industry is expected to grow 32% in 2024,” she said.

Electric vehicles and charging infrastructure are the second area where Sprott projects significant increases in silver demand on the back of massive sales growth for the vehicles themselves.
“After breaking through the one million mark in the U.S. in 2023, an increase of 52% from the previous year, EV sales are expected to power through 2024,” Smirnova said. “Global EV sales are expected to crack 17 million units sold, and the IEA predicts that by 2035, every other car sold globally will be electric.”
She noted that the automotive industry already uses around 80 million ounces of silver per year, and this number is expected to increase to 90 million by 2025. “Silver loadings have been rising over the past few decades and are expected to increase even more in the future,” Smirnova wrote. “In hybrid vehicles, silver use is higher at around 18 to 34 grams per light vehicle, while battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are believed to consume in the range of 25 to 50 grams of silver per vehicle. The move to autonomous driving should dramatically escalate vehicle complexity, requiring even more silver consumption.”
While higher loadings are the primary driver for increased automotive silver demand, the gray metal is also required for charging stations, increased electric power generation and other infrastructure to support electric vehicles. “The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that by 2030, 28 million EV charging ports will be needed to support the fleet of EVs in the U.S.,” she said.

The third industrial area that will materially increase silver demand is the build-out of AI infrastructure, as silver is used in power generation and transmission, as well as in the data centers themselves.
“Silver has the lowest electrical resistance among all metals at standard temperatures and is crucial in many electronic applications, including electrical contacts in switches, transformers, relays and capacitors,” Smirnova wrote. “Additionally, silver will be needed in many forms in the transportation industry, such as semiconductors, harnesses, controls, fuses, switches, electronic control units, infrared radars, laser radar (LIDAR), motion sensors and displays. Healthcare will also play a role, with silver being necessary for wearable devices.”
And while the demand side of the equation continues to grow, the supply side has been stagnant or shrinking. “Silver mine supply has been essentially flat over the last 10 years and declined 1% in 2023,” she noted. “Going forward, mining production is expected to decline another 1% in 2024 to 823 million ounces, the lowest level since 2020 when the Pandemic shut down mines. Recycling or scrap supply is also expected to remain flat this year, leading to a 1% decline in total supply.”
There are also numerous problems that impact silver production and further constrain supply. “Silver mine production is prone to disruptions and unforeseen events, which have culminated in the current supply shortage,” Smirnova wrote. “Additionally, most silver mines are focused on other metals, with silver as a by-product. Only 28.3% of mines that produce silver are primary silver mines.”

Implications for Supply/Demand
Silver’s supply/demand imbalance is expected to worsen, with the supply deficit projected to rise by 17% in 2024, while industrial demand will increase by 9%. “We have already seen a decline of ~480 million ounces of silver held on the major exchanges since February 2021,” she pointed out.

“One can only postulate the amount of time it will take to deplete the remaining ounces, given the metal’s precarious supply/demand situation,” she concluded. “We believe the global energy transition will be highly positive for silver, leading to much higher prices for silver bullion and equities.”
Spot silver was trading above $32 per ounce overnight, but it pulled back during the European and North American sessions, last trading at $31.239 per ounce for a loss of 2.22% on the 24-hour chart.

90,"May 30, 2024","Gold ETP outflows may have stopped, hinting at further upside in H2 2024 – WisdomTree’s Nitesh Shah","
(Kitco News) – With athletes around the world preparing for this summer's Olympic games in Paris, one analyst likened the yellow metal's recent rally to a sprint against the best runners in the world, with the lustrous metal “heading for gold.”
 
According to Nitesh Shah, Head of Commodities and Macroeconomic Research at WisdomTree Europe, “Exchange-traded product (ETP) investors who had sat on the sidelines for some time are now starting to cheer the metal on in some corners of the world,” and the primary hope is that “the metal doesn’t run out of energy too soon.” 
 
“Gold hit a fresh high once again on 17 May 2024 at US$2402.60/oz1,” Shah said. “Since its previous high on 12 April 2024 (at US$2401.5/oz), gold eased for most of the month on expectations of ‘higher for longer’ interest rate expectations in the US. The March US consumer price index [CPI] inflation, which was printed in April, was a catalyst for gold strength despite the elevated bond yields and strong dollar headwinds.”
 
While the March CPI provided a boost to gold, April’s CPI print didn’t have the same effect, he noted, as “it missed market expectations.”
 
“However, a growing sense that it affords the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) to cut rates earlier has helped the metal move to a fresh high,” Shah said. “Indeed, retail sales and industrial production data misses in April have also given the market more hope that one to two rate cuts will indeed be delivered this year (even if not the six the market was expecting at the beginning of the year).” 
 

 
A dip in the U.S. dollar has also benefited gold over the past three weeks, he noted. 
 

 
And a drop in bond yields during that period has also been a boon for the precious metal. 
 

 
“Sentiment towards gold remains strong, with net speculative positioning hovering at the 230k handle since mid-April 2024,” Shah said. 
 

 
He highlighted investment demand for physical gold in China as the primary source of strength for the precious metal over the past month. 
 
“Chinese gold ETPs have seen inflows five months in a row,” Shah noted. “April attracted RMB9bn (US$1.3bn), the strongest month on record, pushing the total assets under management (AUM) to another historical high of RMB46bn (US$6.4bn). Meanwhile, holdings also registered the largest ever monthly increase, rising 17t to 84t.”
 
The one industry that has seen a cool-down in demand is the jewelry sector, which Shah attributed to the rapid rise in gold prices. 
 
“April is normally a period for retailers to restock ahead of the May Day Holiday (1-5 May),” he said. “However, this year, retailers approached the period with caution given the higher prices and consumer price sensitivity. Indeed, Shanghai premiums over London prices have eased, indicating less willingness to pay over the odds for the metal.”
 
It was a similar story in India, which saw a 50% year-over-year (y/y) reduction in demand in March amid rising prices. 
 
“Indian gold bullion imports more than halved y/y to 30t in March due to higher prices and weak consumer demand,” Shah said. “Following the recent price pull-back, there has been a slight improvement in physical demand. However, volumes have remained weaker than in a normal period of weddings and ahead of Akshaya Tritiya (an extremely auspicious day to buy gold, which fell on 10 May this year).”
 
Global ETP flows remain the primary outlier as they “have been negative over the past year, indicating that many institutional investors do not share the same level of enthusiasm for the metal as the retail market,” Shah said. 
 

 
“However, Chinese investors have bucked this trend,” he concluded. “In recent weeks, we have witnessed some strong flows into US-domiciled ETPs as well, possibly pointing to outflows reaching a base.”"
91,"May 30, 2024",Expect gold’s rally to resume in the latter half of 2024 and into 2025 – NUS’s Xe Le,"
(Kitco News) – After years of trading in a range below $2,000 per ounce, gold has seen its best performance since 2019 as the yellow metal surged to a new all-time high near $2,450 in early May, and looks poised to continue its trek higher, according to one academic. 
 
In a recent article written by Xu Le, a lecturer in the Department of Strategy and Policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School, Le laid out her reasoning for why gold prices are expected to rise in the latter half of 2024 and in 2025, pointing to increased demand from central banks in East and Central Asia, and a rise economic uncertainty. 
 
“Many investors believe that gold, as a versatile precious metal, traditionally shows an inverse correlation with Federal rates,” she said. “Given its denomination in dollars, when interest rates climb and the U.S. dollar strengthens, gold prices generally decline. However, this relationship has appeared to be less predictable recently. Over the past few years, despite high Federal rates and a stable U.S. dollar, gold prices have not only held firm but have soared to new heights.”
 
Le said this shows that while the influence of the U.S. dollar on gold prices “is significant,” it’s only one of a number of factors that play crucial roles, including inflation, monetary policy, and supply and demand. 
 
As global economic conditions grow more uncertain by the day, Le said gold has stepped “into the spotlight, offering investors a sanctuary to shield their wealth amid economic uncertainty and escalating inflationary pressures.” 
 
“Gold serves as a hedge against inflation, and this is a key reason why investors turn to it in times of economic turbulence,” she said. “During times of escalating inflation, the general price level surges, diminishing the purchasing power of fiat currencies. At such times, gold steps into the spotlight, offering investors a sanctuary to shield their wealth amid economic uncertainty and escalating inflationary pressures. Gold is no doubt recognised as a safe-haven asset, especially during periods of turbulence.”
 
Citing the string of aggressive rate hikes implemented by the U.S. Federal Reserve starting in March 2022, Le said the move was intended to help mitigate inflation and bolster the U.S. dollar, which would typically “diminish the attractiveness of non-yielding assets like gold.”
 
“Indeed, gold prices experienced a dip to around US$1,664 per ounce in 2022,” she noted. “However, the story of gold’s resilience is also shaped by other dynamic factors, including a slowdown in interest rate hikes, global economic uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions. By the end of 2023, gold prices had rebounded significantly to US$2,078 per ounce. The average gold price for 2023 stood at US$1,940.54 per ounce, marking an 8% increase over 2022.”
 
For the Federal Reserve, things have not quite gone as planned in the intervening years as the central bank continues to struggle to achieve their 2% inflation target, leading to a delay in the expected rate cuts. 
 
“Given this complex economic landscape and other uncertainties, the gold price is expected to maintain its stability in the near term,” Le said. “Looking ahead, the potential reduction in rates could see gold prices climbing once more. Investing in gold is a prudent strategy for those seeking to combat inflation and diversify their investment portfolio. With its nature as a safe haven, gold is expected to sustain its influence, pushing its price higher in the latter half of 2024 and in 2025.”
 
One of the most significant factors in shaping recent trends in gold prices is increased demand coming from central banks, “particularly in the emerging markets of East and Central Asia,” Le noted. 
 
“According to a recent report from the World Gold Council, these regions have spearheaded net gold purchases in the first quarter,” she said. “This aligns with the 2023 Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey, which indicates a minor strategic shift towards greater allocations of gold in national reserves over the next five years.”
 
Le added that the trend of de-dollarization is starting to pick up steam, “with many countries actively diversifying their currency reserves by accumulating gold and alternative currencies.”
 
“A noteworthy example of central banks acquiring gold is China’s central bank, which has been continuing its gold purchasing, marking its 17th consecutive month of purchases in March,” she said. “China’s aggressive accumulation, which included an addition of 60,000 troy ounces in April, signals a robust demand from the official sector currently driving gold’s price surge.”
 
Since October 2022, gold’s share of China’s total reserves has climbed from 3.2% to 4.6%, Le noted, but said it still remains well below the gold reserves held by countries like the U.S., Germany, Italy, and France, “where gold has a much larger share at around more than 65% of their national reserves.” 
 
Citing comments from Zhao Qingming, vice president of the China Foreign Exchange Investment Research Institute, Le said the ongoing expansion of gold reserves aligns with China’s long-term strategic interests and is “aimed at optimizing and diversifying the structure of reserve assets, enhancing overall reserve stability.”
 
She also noted that demand for gold jewelry in China increased by 10% in 2023, while investments in gold bars jumped 28%. 
 
“The enthusiasm for gold extends not only to the officials-level in China but also to its retail market,” Le said. “China’s gold market represents approximately one-fifth of global sales.”
 
Another notable development highlighted by Le is the rise in demand from younger demographics, “who are increasingly turning to gold as an investment vehicle amid lacklustre performance in other domestic assets like real estate and stocks.”
 
“Overall, amid a landscape of growing geopolitical tensions and global uncertainties, such as upcoming general elections in the U.S. and other countries, the role of gold as a stable investment continues to be reinforced,” Le concluded. “Central Banks in markets such as China, India, and Turkey are proactively boosting their gold reserves. Therefore, these multifaceted dynamics are expected to continue bolstering gold prices in the foreseeable future.”"

95,"May 30, 2024",Will food inflation spike again?,"
The inflation situation in the United States appears to be stabilizing. For example, food prices remained stable in April, although food inflation rose 2.2% from last year.
However, Fed members remain cautious in predicting changes in monetary policy. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari emphasized the need for the regulator to wait for substantial progress in inflation before thinking about cutting rates.
He also suggested that the central bank might even consider raising rates if inflation does not come down. It is worth mentioning that the minutes of the last FOMC meeting did not show any change towards a more lax stance either.
Why the pessimism and doubts?
There are three main reasons. First, the U.S. economy remains incredibly resilient, with a strong labor market and stable consumer demand. This resilience makes it difficult to control inflation.
The second factor is geopolitics. New tensions in the Red Sea and supply chain disruptions are driving up logistics costs. With the peak shipping season underway, container shipping rates have risen by more than 30% in recent weeks.
Shipping companies are forced to seek alternative routes, leading to delays and further price increases. Additionally, the instability in the region could affect oil supply in the short term, further increasing logistics costs and potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to postpone cutting interest rates. The US dollar index has also reversed its trend since the start of the year. 
Finally, natural disasters are also contributing. Dry weather in Russia, the world's largest wheat exporter, has reduced export forecasts and pushed wheat prices near their annual high after six months of calm.
In Australia, a summer drought affected the crop, although subsequent rains helped stabilize the situation. In Western Europe, a wet spring has affected winter crop quality in the UK, Germany, and France.
What next?
It is premature to sound the alarm bells and predict a significant spike in inflation in the coming months. For example, cocoa bean prices have been high for some time without causing widespread problems.
The same is true of the rise in robusta coffee futures. Although some commodities may experience price spikes, this does not spell disaster for the overall economic outlook.
However, demand for bonds among investors is growing due to the Fed's tough stance and investment houses' predictions that rates will not fall until September.
To assess the extent to which this is realistic, we must examine the macroeconomic data, which do not support an early review of monetary policy at the moment.
US business activity has accelerated sharply, reaching its fastest pace in more than two years. This suggests the Fed's 2% inflation target remains out of reach.
And the markets?
Despite the uncertain outlook for rate cuts, optimism persists. Investors believe the economy will withstand despite the Fed's tough stance. However, only time will tell whether this optimism is justified."
96,"May 29, 2024","Gold Tumbles as Stronger Dollar, Rising Yields Cast Doubt on 2023 Rate Cuts","Gold prices fell sharply on Thursday, as U.S. dollar gains and climbing Treasury yields sparked concerns over the Federal Reserve's anticipated path of interest rate cuts this year.
The precious metal's decline came ahead of a critical inflation report due on Friday, with investors bracing for potential surprises that could force the Fed to recalibrate its monetary policy outlook.
At the center of attention is the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for April, set to be released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, capturing changes in consumer spending across a wide range of goods and services.Treasury yields surged on Thursday, reflecting muted demand at this week's $183 billion bond auctions, as investors grew wary of persistent inflationary pressures amid improving economic growth prospects.

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari's comments, which did not rule out another rate hike, had a strong impact on market sentiment. Yields climb, with the 10-year note yield reaching a one-month high of 5.471% and the 2-year note yielding 4.958%.
According to the CME's FedWatch tool, markets are pricing in a near-certainty that the Fed will maintain its current benchmark interest rate of 5.25%-5.5% at the June meeting. However, the probability shifts substantially in favor of rate cuts later in the year, with a 12.3% chance of a cut in July and a 47% chance in September.
As of 6:50 PM ET, the gold futures contract for August 2024 is currently fixed at $2,359, down $15.20 or 0.64%, and an additional decline of $4.70 (0.20 %) in Australia. The U.S. dollar index gained 0.51% to 105.164, a major factor in gold’s price decline today.

All eyes are now on Friday's PCE report, which will likely shape the Fed's future policy decisions. Market participants are also eagerly awaiting the central bank's updated economic projections and ""dot plot"" forecasts for interest rates, due after the June 12 FOMC meeting. The current ""dot plot"" envisions three rate cuts this year, a scenario that could be revised based on incoming data.

97,"May 29, 2024",Gold investors need to buy the dip because that is what central banks are doing - WisdomTree,"(Kitco News) - Although gold has found solid resistance around $2,400 an ounce, investors should not expect to see any major correction any time soon, according to one market strategist.
Insatiable central bank demand has transformed the gold market, providing solid support for the precious metal. In an interview with Kitco News, Nitesh Shah, Head of Research at WisdomTree, said he expects this demand to stay strong for a while.
Shah expects the gold market to form an interesting pattern in this environment. He explained that while central banks aren’t necessarily concerned with prices, they can still make strategic purchases.
“My guess is that every price dip they see, they'll be buying. Maybe they slowed down the purchase a little bit in response to the high prices, but they know if they want cheaper prices, they need to load up now before the end of the year,” he said.
Along with central bank demand, Shah expects robust demand from Chinese retail investors will also provide solid support at current levels. He added that it's not surprising that Chinese consumers are buying gold nearly as fast as central banks, as they have no other options.
“Even if gold is expensive, it is still going better than equities and the housing market,” he said.
While Shah remains bullish on gold through the rest of the year, he also noted that the broader market lacks a catalyst to spark another run to all-time highs… at least for now. Shah explained that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance is keeping investors out of the gold market.
Shah said that he sees the floodgates opening when the U.S. central bank signals that it is ready to lower interest rates and start a new easing cycle. So far, the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to signal any rate cuts as inflation remains stubbornly elevated. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are not expecting interest rates to remain unchanged through the summer. Markets see a 50/50 chance of a rate cut in September.
Although the Federal Reserve is not ready to cut rates anytime soon, Shah said that he expects easing to start by the end of the year. He added that the central bank will be forced to lower interest rates as the U.S. economy slows.
However, until then, gold prices remain caught in a new consolidation channel. He added that, according to his modeling, gold prices are seen as a little rich in this environment.
Along with gold, Shah also sees solid potential for silver; as industrial demand continues to dominate the marketplace.
Shah noted that even if the global economy slows, demand for silver will remain resilient because it is a critical metal within many different sectors.
While silver is essential in the solar power sector, Shah explained that the growing electrification of the global economy will need more silver.
“The more electronic contact points you have in any application, the more silver you need. And we have this AI revolution going on. As we move our energy consumption away from burning oil, coal, and gas to wind and solar, we will need more electrical contact points, so we need more silver,” he said.
Renewed investor interest in silver has finally propelled it out from under gold’s shadow. Silver prices are trading near an 11-year high, above $32 an ounce. A 4% rally at the start of the week has helped push the gold/silver ratio to 73 points, its lowest level in nearly three years.
While the environment remains favorable for silver, Shah said the market still gets most of its momentum from gold. Although silver can withstand a slowing economy, Shah said it doesn’t do well in an environment of increased geopolitical risks.
He added that gold remains the go-to safe-haven asset when there is a lot of fear in the marketplace.
“It's hard for silver to shake its gold correlation. So the gold correlation will be the most dominant thing driving prices,” he said. “Rate cuts are going to be the next catalyst for prices to move. On the back of that, we'll see the gold rally first, and then silver will follow in a similar way to what we've seen.”"
98,"May 29, 2024",Copper’s had it run but equities still need to catch up - Société Générale,"(Kitco News) - Mining equities are finally garnering attention as one bank sees growing potential as higher commodity prices create some value within the sector.
In its latest research note, equity analysts at Société Générale recommended that investors start looking at the mining sector as it plays catch-up with raw commodities. The French bank also said it prefers mining companies connected to the global green energy transition, preferring base metals over energy producers.
SocGen has been bullish on copper for more than a year; however, it recommends that investors take their profits now that the rally has run its course.
“Since early April, the copper price has hit an all-time high, and the Brent price has gotten lower. Our trade idea turned in a gain of 8.4% in less than five weeks and even 9.7% based on COMEX rather than LME copper prices. As risks gather on the long copper leg of the trade with futures prices now overstretched by investor positionings, we think it is the right moment to close the trade and take profit,” the analysts said.
The analysts noted that stubbornly high inflation worldwide has helped drive commodity prices higher; they added that 79% of the commodities the bank tracks are trading in positive territory so far this year.
However, SocGen said that equity markets don’t reflect this rally in commodities and see an opportunity for the sector to play catch-up. The bank said it sees opportunities for base metal producers versus oil and energy companies.
“In equities, the global energy sector (+7% ytd) is outperforming global mining equities (+3% ytd) despite the relative underperformance of oil within commodities. While copper is the poster child of the energy transition on secular trends, cyclically, our demand driver indicators, such as SG Global Cycle and SG Asian Exports, continue to show improvement, suggesting strong returns ahead for being overweight miners and underweight energy. The current rise in metal prices suggests an inflection in EPS momentum ahead for the mining sector,” the analysts said in the report.
But it’s not just copper that SocGen is looking at. The bank sees opportunities in a basket of base metals, specifically any that has a connection to the ongoing green energy evolution.
“Our Greenflation basket consists of stocks that are primed to gain from surging demand or reduced supply of 24 critical metals needed in climate technology and from stepped-up investment by mining companies. The recent US and UK sanctions on Russian aluminium,copper, and nickel yet again, point to geopolitical challenges in the supply of key metals. This should bode well for our Greenflation companies. Improving bottom-up corporate newsflow and mining sector M&A activity at a 12-year high are also positive signs,” the analysts said.
SocGen’s transition into equity markets comes as copper prices see some technical selling pressure after hitting an all-time high of $5.20 per pound last week. High-grade July copper futures last traded at $4.786 per pound, down more than 1% on the day.
Looking ahead, SocGen expects to see lower prices in the near term.
“Since early March, when the most recent copper rally began, investors have been securing long positions, while producers have been ramping up their hedging activities, effectively securing lucrative selling prices for the future. Both groups are now positioned at unusually high levels, but the rise in long positioning was much sharper for long investors than short producers. This leaves the copper future price very exposed to long liquidations from investors,” the analysts said.
While copper could see further profit taking, the analysts said that other base metals are less exposed.
“The copper futures market is at risk of investors liquidating their longs, but this is much less of a problem with other base metals. This means that bearish news triggering a healthy purge on copper would not affect other metals prices as much, and thus suggests resilience for diversified miners,” the analysts said. "
99,"May 29, 2024","Gold pressured by bearish outside markets, hawkish ‘Fedspeak’","(Kitco News) - Gold prices are solidly lower and silver prices up just a bit in midday U.S. trading Wednesday. The precious metals markets are feeling the bearish effect of comments Tuesday by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who leaned hawkish in his comments on U.S. monetary policy. He said U.S. interest rates will be held steady as long as needed, or even raised if necessary. Bearish daily “outside market” forces are also limiting buying interest in the metals markets at mid-week, as the U.S. dollar index is firmly higher, crude oil prices are weaker and U.S. Treasury yields are on the rise. June gold was last down $14.90 at $2,341.60. July silver was last up $0.093 at $32.22.
Silver prices shot sharply higher Tuesday and challenged the recent 11-year high. Frank Watson of Kinesis says: “Silver’s dual role as a precious and industrial metal means it has also benefited from the current environment of reasonably strong economic growth and high inflation, boosting precious metals as a hedge against rising costs, at the same time as market expectations of interest rate cuts later this year which would reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing assets.”
It’s a busy week for U.S. economic data releases, highlighted by Friday’s personal income and outlays report that includes the closely watched PCE inflation indexes.
In other news, the Chinese yuan is at its weakest level against the U.S. dollar since last November, with Chinese monetary authorities refraining from intervention against the strong greenback. Broker SP Angel said this morning in an email dispatch: “Similarly, the Japanese yen is at multi-year lows alongside the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah. We suggest China may be boosting metal coffers, both base metals like copper and zinc alongside precious metals like silver and gold, to reduce longer term implications of a weaker Chinese currency.”
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index firmly down. Nymex crude oil prices are weaker and trading around $79.50 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is on the rise recently and is presently fetching 4.612%.

Technically, June gold futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but have faded. A bearish double-top reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at the record high of $2,454.20. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the May low of $2,285.20.

100,"June 11, 2024",No title found,"Gold rolls over after retesting key resistance as the outlook for US interest rates remains elevated. 
This keeps the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding Gold high, making it less attractive to investors. 

Gold (XAU/USD) trades a quarter of a percent lower on Tuesday after being rejected by key support-turned-resistance at $2,315 late Monday. 
Higher interest-rate expectations in the US are weighing on the precious metal. The release of better-than-expected US jobs data on Friday suggested continued inflationary pressures. This, in turn, makes it less likely the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower interest rates in September, and the maintenance of higher interest rates increases the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding Gold, making it less attractive to investors.   
Gold weakens after US employment data alters outlook for interest rates
The positive wage-and-employment picture painted by the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data suggested a reappraisal of US interest-rate expectations, with the Fed now expected to maintain interest rates elevated for longer. 
The market’s expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates in September fell to just over 50% after the release of the NFP, from 67% previously, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which bases its estimates on 30-day US Fed Fund Futures pricing data. The current probability stands at around 54%. 
That said, the outlook for global interest rates is more subdued, providing a supportive backdrop for Gold. The Bank of Canada (BoC) cut its overnight rate by 0.25% to 4.75% last week, as did the European Central Bank (ECB). The release of lower inflation data in Switzerland has prompted speculation that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) could also cut interest rates at its June 20 meeting after an initial cut in March. 
Gold traders will now be looking for further cues on price direction at the Federal Reserve June meeting, which concludes on Wednesday, as well as the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May out on the same day. 
Technical Analysis: Gold retests resistance and rolls over
Gold has pulled back to retest the bottom of the range at $2,315, turned over, and begun falling again. Gold is in a short-term downtrend, and given that “the trend is your friend,” it will probably continue lower.  
The next downside target is at about $2,285, the 100% extrapolation of the prior downward movement in May “a”. A stronger move down could see Gold meet support at $2,279 (late April-early May swing low). 
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

On the other hand, a decisive break above the former floor of the range at $2,315 could suggest the short-term downtrend is losing momentum and more upside might be on the horizon. 
Despite short-term weakness, the precious metal’s medium and long-term trends are still bullish, and the risk of a recovery remains high. 


Economic Indicator


Nonfarm Payrolls
The Nonfarm Payrolls release presents the number of new jobs created in the US during the previous month in all non-agricultural businesses; it is released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The monthly changes in payrolls can be extremely volatile. The number is also subject to strong reviews, which can also trigger volatility in the Forex board. Generally speaking, a high reading is seen as bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is seen as bearish, although previous months' reviews ​and the Unemployment Rate are as relevant as the headline figure. The market's reaction, therefore, depends on how the market assesses all the data contained in the BLS report as a whole.

Why it matters to traders?
America’s monthly jobs report is considered the most important economic indicator for forex traders. Released on the first Friday following the reported month, the change in the number of positions is closely correlated with the overall performance of the economy and is monitored by policymakers. Full employment is one of the Federal Reserve’s mandates and it considers developments in the labor market when setting its policies, thus impacting currencies. Despite several leading indicators shaping estimates, Nonfarm Payrolls tend to surprise markets and trigger substantial volatility. Actual figures beating the consensus tend to be USD bullish.

The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of troy ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one troy ounce of Gold, stood at 78.90 on Tuesday, up from 77.68 on Monday.
Investors might use this ratio to determine the relative valuation of Gold and Silver. Some may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued – or Gold is overvalued – and might buy Silver or sell Gold accordingly. Conversely, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.



Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price suffers from diminishing bets for a September Fed rate cut move

The upbeat US Nonfarm Payrolls released on Friday fueled speculations that the Federal Reserve will keep rates higher for longer and turn out to be a key factor acting as a headwind for the non-yielding Comex Gold price. 
The chances of a rate cut in September fell to around 50% following the US jobs data and the markets are now pricing in just one cut of 25 basis points this year, either at the November or December policy meeting.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond holds steady above 4.45%, while the yield on the rate-sensitive two-year US Treasury note remains close to 5.0%, which, in turn, is underpinning the US Dollar.
The USD Index, which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, stands tall near its highest level since May 14 set on Monday and contributes to capping the upside for the USD-denominated commodity.
French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap elections later this month increased political uncertainty in the Eurozone's second-biggest economy and could lend support to the XAU/USD. 
Traders also seem reluctant and keenly await this week's key US macro data – the latest consumer inflation figures – and the crucial FOMC decision on Wednesday before placing aggressive directional bets.

 


Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

103,"June 10, 2024",No title found,"Gold trims some of last week’s losses, posts gains of over 0.50% despite USD strength.
US Nonfarm Payrolls report shows resilient labor market with 272,000 jobs added.
Upcoming US inflation data and Fed decisions are likely to impact Gold's future trajectory.

Gold posted solid gains on Monday, rising more than 0.50% as US Treasury yields climbed. Although the yellow metal exchanged hands above last week’s low of $2,277, it is on the defensive amid broad US Dollar strength ahead of the release of crucial US economic data. The XAU/USD trades at $2,311 at the time of writing.
Last week’s US Nonfarm Payrolls for May showed that the labor market remains resilient even though previous reports showed that it was cooling. Nevertheless, 272,000 jobs were created, more than the estimated 185,000. In the same report, the Unemployment Rate rose, while Average Hourly Earnings increased slightly.
Given the backdrop, this week’s inflation report in the US would be crucial. Most analysts estimate inflation to remain at familiar levels, which could reaffirm the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) rhetoric of keeping interest rates “higher for longer.” On the other hand, a reacceleration could prompt Fed officials to adjust their rhetoric, which could pave the way for further losses to the non-yielding metal.
After the US inflation data is released, the Fed will announce its monetary policy decision and update the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). Any hawkish tilts in the message or the dot plot could trigger volatility among market participants.
In the meantime, the US 10-year Treasury note yield edges up three-and-a-half basis points to 4.47%, a headwind for the yellow metal. Consequently, the DXY, an index of the US Dollar against six other currencies, increased 0.23% to 105.17.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price recovers after strong US jobs report

News that the People’s Bank of China paused its 18-month bullion buying spree weighed on the precious metal. “Holdings of the precious metal by the PBOC held steady at 72.80 million troy ounces for May,” according to MarketWatch.
Upcoming US CPI report for May is expected to show headline inflation at 3.4% YoY, while core CPI is foreseen dipping from 3.6% to 3.5% YoY.
Last week, employment data in the United States spurred speculation that the Fed will keep rates higher for longer.
Last week’s US data decreased the odds for a Fed rate cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, from above 50% to 46.7%.
December’s 2024 fed funds futures contract hints that investors expect 28 basis points of rate cuts by the Fed throughout the year.

Technical analysis: Gold price climbs, hovers around $2,310
Gold price consolidates above $2,300, even though a Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern emerged. Momentum shifted bearishly as shown by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has pierced below the 50-midline, an indication that sellers are in charge.
Therefore, further Gold weakness and sellers could push the spot price below $2,300. Once cleared, the next stop would be the May 3 low of $2,277, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie beneath with buyers’ next line of defense at around the $2,200 figure.
On the flip side, if Gold buyers lift prices above $2,350, look for a consolidation in the $2,350-$2,380 area.

104,"June 10, 2024",No title found,"Gold pauses and consolidates following a steep sell-off on Friday. 
US employment data showed more people joined the workforce in May, and wages rose higher than expected. 
The data makes it less likely the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, reducing Gold's attractiveness to investors. 

Gold (XAU/USD) price takes a breather on Monday after sliding almost three and a half percentage points on Friday after the release of better-than-expected US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data. The yellow metal trades just above $2,300 amid a mixed market mood. 
The rosy wage-and-employment picture painted by the US employment data on Friday suggested a radical reappraisal of US interest-rate expectations, with the Federal Reserve (Fed) now expected to maintain interest rates elevated for longer. This, in turn, had an immediate bearish effect on Gold by raising the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding precious metal, making it less attractive to investors.   
Gold weakens after US employment data recalibrates interest-rate expectations
Gold price resumed its short-term bearish tone at the end of last week after the US NFP data showed a higher-than-forecast 272K rise in the number of new workers joining the economy in May, beating economists’ estimates of 185K and rising from a downwardly revised 165K in April. 
Not only did payrolls beat expectations, but the data also showed Average Hourly Earnings rising by 4.1% YoY in May, more than the 3.9% forecast and the upwardly revised 4.0% in April. This suggests workers are earning more, which could push up spending and, in turn, inflation. 
The market’s expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates in September fell to just over 50% after the release of the NFP from 67% previously, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which bases its estimates on 30-day US Fed Fund Futures pricing data. 
That said, Gold price is supported by the different outlook for global interest-rate expectations, which remain depressed. The Bank of Canada (BoC) cut its overnight rate by 0.25% to 4.75% last week, as did the European Central Bank (ECB). The release of lower inflation data in Switzerland has prompted speculation the Swiss National Bank (SNB) could also cut interest rates at its June 20 meeting following an initial cut in March. 
Gold traders will now be looking for further cues on price direction at the Federal Reserve June meeting, which concludes on Wednesday, as well as the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May out earlier on the same day. 
Asian passion for Gold abates
Gold was further pressured at the end of last week following the release of official data showing that the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) had halted buying of more Gold in May, ending an 18-month buying spree for the central bank.  
The data followed strong buying in April that saw China Gold reserves at the PBoC hit an all-time high, accounting for 4.9% of total reserves, and following 18 consecutive months of growth. 
Technical Analysis: Gold pauses during sell-off
Gold price broke below the $2,315 range low on Friday and hit an initial downside target at $2,303, generated by the original trendline break in May. This target was at the 0.618 Fibonacci ratio of the length of the move prior to the trendline break, “a,” extrapolated lower as “b” (see chart below). 
The next target, which has also almost been met, is at about $2,285, the 100% extrapolation of “a”. A stronger move down could see Gold meet support at $2,279 (late April-early May swing low). 
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator has briefly dipped into the oversold region before exiting and rising back above 30.00, indicating the possibility Gold may pullback in the short-term. However, such is the strength of the prior down move that Gold is likely to resume moving lower once the pullback completes. 
Despite short-term weakness, the precious metal’s medium and long-term trends are still bullish, and the risk of a recovery remains high.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) rose on Monday, according to FXStreet data. Silver trades at $29.64 per troy ounce, up 1.61% from the $29.17 it cost on Friday.
Silver prices have increased by 16.37% since the beginning of the year.

The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of troy ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one troy ounce of Gold, stood at 77.40 on Monday, down from 78.63 on Friday.
Investors might use this ratio to determine the relative valuation of Gold and Silver. Some may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued – or Gold is overvalued – and might buy Silver or sell Gold accordingly. Conversely, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.



Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price struggles to lure buyers amid reduced Fed rate cut bets, bullish USD

The upbeat US employment details released on Friday fueled speculations that the Federal Reserve could delay the start of the rate-cutting cycle, which, in turn, is seen capping the upside for the non-yielding Comex Gold price.
The headline NFP showed that the US economy added 272K jobs in May as compared to the 185K anticipated and the previous month's upwardly revised 175K, overshadowing an uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.0%.
Furthermore, Average Hourly Earnings surpassed consensus estimates and increased by 4.1% during the 12 months through May, which might push up prices and require the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond jumped to 4.45% after the data, while the rate-sensitive 2-year yield remains close to 5.0%, underpinning the US Dollar and acting as a headwind for the XAU/USD.
Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) snapped 18 months of continuous Gold buying in May, raising concern about decreasing demand for the bullion in one of the world’s biggest buyers and favoring bearish traders. 
Investors, however, prefer to wait on the sidelines ahead of this week's release of the latest US consumer inflation figures and the highly-anticipated FOMC monetary policy decision on Wednesday before placing directional bets.
The chances of a rate cut in September fell to around 50% following the US jobs data, from around 70% on Thursday, and the markets are now pricing in just one cut of 25 basis points this year, either in November or December. 
Hence, investors will look for fresh signals on when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates amid the still resilient US economy, which will play a key role in determining the next leg of a directional move for the commodity.

107,"June 10, 2024",No title found,"Gold price remains on the defensive around $2,295 in Friday’s early Asian session. 
The US economy added 272K jobs in May, above expectations of 185K new roles.
The Chinese central bank paused gold purchases in May after 18 months of buying. 

Gold price (XAU/USD) trims losses near $2,295 despite the stronger US Dollar (USD) on Monday during the early Asian session. The yellow metal edges lower to one-month lows on Friday amid lower bets on US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts this year and bearish sentiment fueled by news indicating that China paused gold purchases in May after 18 months of buying. 

The US employment data came in better than expected and prompted traders to push back the expected timing of Fed rate cuts. On Friday, the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) for May rose 272K from a 165K increase in April (revised from 175K), according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Meanwhile, the Unemployment Rate increased to 4.0% in May from 3.9% in April. The US Dollar (USD) attracts some buyers in response to the stronger data and weighs on the gold price as it makes bullion more expensive for overseas buyers.

The gold market is seeing a bit of liquidation, along with other metals since the data shows the US economy is quite robust and the Fed may delay that first rate cut, said Blue Line Futures chief market strategist, Phillip Streible. The financial markets are now pricing in nearly 49% odds of a rate cut for the September meeting, down from 68% before the NFP data, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Furthermore, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), one of the world’s biggest gold buyers for years, snapped 18 months of continuous gold buying in May as the price hit record highs in April and May, per Bloomberg. The concern about decreasing demand for gold exerted some selling pressure on the precious metal. 

China held 72.80 million troy ounces of gold at the end of May, which remained constant from the end of April, the data showed. Meanwhile, the value of China’s gold reserves increased to $170.96 billion at the end of May from $167.96 billion in April.

China’s People’s Bank halts 18-month Gold buying spree, exerts downward pressure on XAU/USD.
US Treasury yields surge with the 10-year yield up to 4.43%, bolstering the Greenback and pushing Gold’s price lower.
Traders eye US inflation data and Fed policy meeting next week.

Gold prices plummeted to a four-week low after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that the labor market remained strong, and China halted its purchase of the golden metal. Therefore, with the XAU/USD trading at $2,295, the non-yielding metal dropped by more than 3%.
The latest US Nonfarm Payrolls report for May revealed the labor market added more people to the workforce, smashing estimates. Despite that, the same report revealed an uptick in the Unemployment Rate, while Average Hourly Earnings witnessed a slight increase.
After the data release, XAU/USD extended its fall, which began during Friday’s Asian session. News that the People’s Bank of China paused its 18-month bullion buying spree weighed on the precious metal.
“Holdings of the precious metal by the PBOC held steady at 72.80 million troy ounces for May,” according to MarketWatch.
So far, Gold has traveled from $2,387 to $2,304 and is about to fall beneath the $2,300 mark. In the meantime, US Treasury bond yields are skyrocketing, with the 10-year bond yield climbing 14 basis points to 4.43%, underpinning the Greenback.
The DXY, an index of the US Dollar against six other currencies, increased 0.79% to 104.91.
Market participants turn to next week's US inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy meeting. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to remain steady, but a reacceleration could trigger further losses for the golden metal.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price on the defensive after strong US jobs report

US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that May's Nonfarm Payrolls increased by 272,000, surpassing the forecast of 185,000 and April’s figure of 165,000.
The Unemployment Rate jumped from 3.9% to 4%, while Average Hourly Earnings increased by 4.1% YoY, up from the previous 4%.
A stronger-than-expected US NFP report sparked speculation that the Fed will keep rates higher for longer.
After the data release, the December 2024 CBOT fed funds rate futures contract expects 27 basis points (bps) of easing, 12 bps less than on Thursday.
Odds for a Fed rate cut in September were lowered from 55% to 47%.

Technical analysis: Gold price collapses below $2,300
Gold prices retreat sharply and appear to form a Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern, which could lower the price of the yellow metal. Momentum has shifted bearish due to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) piercing below the 50-midline, indicating that sellers are in charge.
Therefore, further Gold weakness and sellers could push the spot price below $2,300. Once cleared, the next stop would be the May 3 low of $2,277, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie beneath, with buyers’ next line of defense at around the $2,200 figure.
Conversely, if Gold buyers lift prices above $2,350, look for a consolidation in the $2,350-$2,380 area.




Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

109,"June 07, 2024",No title found,"Gold price declines after the release of US Nonfarm Payrolls data for May, shows a higher-than-expected change in employment and wages.
Gold was already trending lower after data unveiling PBoC reserves showed no change in May compared to April. 
Short-term technical picture remains volatile as Gold whipsaws higher and then lower. 

Gold (XAU/USD) falls all the way back to the $2,310s on Friday after the release of US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data shows the US economy added 272K jobs in May when 185K had been expected. The result was also higher than the April figure which was revised down to 165K.
The US Bureau of Statistics (BLS) report showed a rise in Average Hourly Earnings of 4.1% YoY from a revised-up 4.0% in April, and beat estimates of 3.9%. 

The Unemployment Rate rose to 4.0%, however, when 3.9% had been forecast from 3.9% previously, 
Overall the BLS data suggested wage inflation was rising which could feed into higher core and headline inflation. This, in turn, could lead the Federal Reserve (Fed) to delay its decision to cut interest rates. Maintaining higher interest rates for longer is negative for Gold as it raises the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset. 
Gold was already falling on Friday after the news that the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) suddenly halted its Gold purchases in May after an 18-month buying stretch.  
Gold price deflates after People’s Bank of China halts further buying
Gold is trending lower at the end of the week after the news that Gold reserves at the PBoC remained unchanged at 72.8 million troy ounces at the end of May, the exact same figure as at the end of April, according to official data from the PBoC on Friday. 
The data follows strong buying in April that saw China Gold reserves at the PBoC hit an all-time high, accounting for 4.9% of total reserves, and following 18 consecutive months of growth. 
Central bank buying, especially in Asia, is now a key driver of Gold price. It was probably behind the rally in 2024 which saw Gold reach a record high of $2,450 in May. According to the World Gold Council (WGC) unreported over-the-counter buying (i.e not through exchanges) by central banks was a significant driver of Gold’s strength. 
“Looking at our Gold Return Attribution Model (GRAM), there was no single variable that stood out as a key driver in May,” says the WGC report for May. “Momentum and a weaker US Dollar were positive drivers but their impact was marginal. And while the unexplained component of the model shrank considerably in May, it was still the largest factor by far. As we have noted previously, we believe some of this can be attributed to strong over-the-counter buying, including central bank purchases which have been a notable contributor to recent Gold returns.” 
Asian and emerging market country central banks have been hoarding Gold reserves as a hedge against the threat of devaluation of their own currencies, especially against the US Dollar (USD). The revision of interest-rate expectations by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in the spring led to a strengthening of USD, which increased the reserve-hoarding trend.  
That said, a recent run of poor US data means investors are renewing bets the Fed will start cutting interest rates in September, with the probabilities at around 67%, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which bases its estimates on 30-day US Fed Fund Futures pricing data. 
Additionally, at a global level, interest-rate expectations are falling. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada (BoC) cut its overnight rate to 4.75% from 5.00% and the European Central Bank (ECB) followed the day after. The release of lower inflation data in Switzerland has now prompted speculation the Swiss National Bank (SNB) could also cut interest rates at its June 20 meeting following an earlier cut in March. 
Technical Analysis: Gold breaks out of top of range, then dumps
Gold price has broken out of the top of a mini-range, stretching from roughly $2,315 to $2,358, but since reversed course and dumped. It has now fallen back inside the range. 
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

A break below the $2,315 range low would reactivate downside targets generated by the trendline break. The first target for the follow-through is at $2,303 – the 0.618 Fibonacci extrapolation of “a”. A stronger move down could even see Gold reach support at $2,279. The targets are calculated using the length of the move prior to the break as a guide.  
On Thursday, Gold broke out of its mini-range and hit an initial target at $2,385, the 0.618 Fibonacci extrapolation of the height of the range from the breakout point higher, before reversing and crashing back down on Friday. 
Despite the short-term weakness, the precious metal’s medium and long-term trends are still bullish, and the risk of a recovery remains high. 



Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) fell on Friday, according to FXStreet data. Silver trades at $30.81 per troy ounce, down 1.62% from the $31.32 it cost on Thursday.
Silver prices have increased by 20.97% since the beginning of the year.

The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of troy ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one troy ounce of Gold, stood at 76.26 on Friday, up from 75.86 on Thursday.
Investors might use this ratio to determine the relative valuation of Gold and Silver. Some may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued – or Gold is overvalued – and might buy Silver or sell Gold accordingly. Conversely, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.



Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price turns cautious ahead of key US jobs data

Growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates later this year amid signs of a slowdown in the US economy continues to lend some support to the non-yielding Comex Gold price. 
The US Department of Labor (DoL) reported on Thursday that the number of Americans applying for unemployment insurance benefits increased more than expected by 229K in the week ending June 1.
This, along with Wednesday's ADP report on private-sector employment, suggests that the US labor market is cooling, cementing bets for a September Fed rate cut and weighing on the US Treasury bond yields. 
The yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond languishes near its lowest level in two months, which, in turn, is seen undermining the US Dollar and acting as a tailwind for the yellow metal. 
The underlying strong bullish sentiment across the global equity markets might hold back traders from positioning for any further gains ahead of the release of the crucial US monthly employment details.
The popularly known Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report is expected to show that the US economy added 185K jobs in May as compared to 175K previous and the unemployment rate held steady at 3.9%. 
Apart from this, Average Hourly Earnings will influence the inflation trajectory and the Fed's future policy decision, which, in turn, will help in determining the next leg of a directional move for the XAU/USD.

112,"June 06, 2024",No title found,"Gold climbs 0.54% and reaches a two-week high of $2,378.
Higher-than-expected US jobless claims weaken US Dollar and stabilize Treasury yields.
Traders focus on upcoming Nonfarm Payrolls; forecasts suggest 185,000 new jobs with a 3.9% Unemployment Rate.

Gold hit a two-week high of $2,378 on Thursday after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced weaker-than-expected jobs data that kept US Treasury bond yields virtually unchanged, a tailwind for the golden metal. The XAU/USD trades at $2,369, registering a gain of 0.54% after bouncing off weekly lows of $2,320.
US jobs data was one of the main drivers of the day after the BLS revealed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits exceeded the consensus and the previous week's reading. In addition, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to cut interest rates, which sent US Treasury yields climbing before paring its earlier gains.
The US 10-year benchmark is set to print weekly losses yet retreated from a daily high of 4.32% to 4.285% following the ECB’s decision. In the meantime, the US Dollar Index, which measures the Greenback’s performance against a basket of six currencies, dropped 0.12% to 104.14.
Following the latest US employment data, traders' focus shifts to Friday's May Nonfarm Payrolls report. Estimates suggest the economy will add 185,000 people to the workforce, above April’s 175,000. The Unemployment Rate is expected to be 3.9%, and Average Hourly Earnings are projected to remain unchanged at 3.9%.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price capitalizes on falling US Treasury yields

US Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending May 31 rose by 229,000, above estimates of 220,000 and the previous reading of 221,000
ADP Employment Change revealed that private US hiring in May rose by 152K, below estimates of 175K and missing April’s 188K.
Softer-than-expected Nonfarm Payrolls data could increase the odds of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
Data from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) revealed that traders expect 39 basis points (bps) of interest rate cuts toward the end of 2024 via the December fed funds rate futures contract.
According to the CME FedWatch Tool, traders are currently pricing in a 57% chance of a rate cut in September.
Last week, the US Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE), the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, stabilized, boosting hopes for potential rate cuts.

Technical analysis: Gold price shedges higher above $2,350
Gold extended its rally after consolidating within the $2,320 to $2,360 region, but buyers cracking the top of the range opened the door for further gains. Momentum remains on the buyers' side as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains bullish.
On further strength, XAU/USD's next resistance would be $2,400, followed by the year-to-date high of $2,450. Conversely, if Gold slips below $2,350, the next support would be the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $2,337. The next stop would be the May 8 low of $2,303, followed by the May 3 cycle low of $2,277.

113,"June 06, 2024",No title found,"Gold trades higher as bets the Fed will cut rates in September remain elevated despite strong US service sector data. 
The BoC and ECB have both cut interest rates in recent days and the SNB could later in June –  all positives for non-yielding Gold. 
Gold breaks out of its range higher, muddying the short-term technical picture. 

Gold (XAU/USD) is trading up by about 0.2% in the $2,360s on Thursday just after the European Central Bank (ECB) decides to cuts interest rates by 0.25% at its June policy meeting. The decision to lower interest rates is positive for Gold as it broadly reduces the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset. 
Gold is further supported by continued elevated expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates as soon as September, despite the release of higher-than-expected US Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) Services PMI data on Wednesday.  
Gold rises as markets anticipate lower interest rates
Gold pushes higher on Thursday as investors continue to bet on the Fed cutting interest rates, with the probabilities standing at 69% that the rate being lower than the current level in September, based on the CME FedWatch tool, which bases its estimates on 30-day US Fed Fund Futures pricing data. The anticipation of lower interest rates is positive for Gold as it reduces the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset. 
Globally, interest rate expectations are falling. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada (BoC) cut its overnight rate to 4.75% from 5.00% and on Thursday the European Central Bank (ECB) did the same, cutting its main refinancing rate by 0.25% to 4.25%. After the release of lower inflation data in Switzerland, speculation is also rising for the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to cut its key rate when it makes its decision on June 20. 
Service sector data ends poor run, Nonfarm Payrolls eyed
The outlook for the US economy gained a lift on Wednesday after a combination of higher-than-expected ISM Services PMI data for May and tech-sector optimism. The move led to a rebound in the US Dollar (USD). 
US employment data on Friday is keenly awaited and could impact Gold price. The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report is expected to show a rise of 185K in May, however, negative JOLTS Job Openings data and a lower-than-expected ADP Employment Change this week have reduced investor-optimism regarding the US Bureau of Labor Statistics report. 
If the NFPs also show weakness, it would probably weigh on the USD and further increase bets the Fed will cut interest rates early, providing a backwind to Gold price.  
Technical Analysis: Gold breaks out of range, bringing downtrend into doubt
Gold price has broken out of the mini-range that stretches between $2,315 and $2,358. The upside break brings the short-term downtrend into doubt and could mark a reversal. 
XAU/USD’s break above the range high generates a target at $2,385, the 0.618 Fibonacci extrapolation of the height of the range from the breakout point higher. A move above $2,375 would increase confirmation the target will get hit. 
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

The break below the trendline in May generated downside targets. These are now brought into doubt by the upside break, however, a move back inside the range and then a break below the $2,315 range low would reactivate them. 
The length of the move prior to a break can be used as a guide to the follow-through move after a break, according to technical analysis. The first target for the follow-through is at $2,303 – the 0.618 Fibonacci extrapolation of “a”. A stronger move down could even see Gold reach support at $2,279. 
The precious metal’s medium and long-term trends are still bullish, and the risk of a recovery remains high.


Economic Indicator


ECB Main Refinancing Operations Rate
One of the three key interest rates set by the European Central Bank (ECB), the main refinancing operations rate is the interest rate the ECB charges to banks for one-week long loans. It is announced by the European Central Bank at its eight scheduled annual meetings. If the ECB expects inflation to rise, it will increase its interest rates to bring it back down to its 2% target. This tends to be bullish for the Euro (EUR), since it attracts more foreign capital inflows. Likewise, if the ECB sees inflation falling it may cut the main refinancing operations rate to encourage banks to borrow and lend more, in the hope of driving economic growth. This tends to weaken the Euro as it reduces its attractiveness as a place for investors to park capital.

US 10-year Treasury yield drops to lowest level since April, following a softer-than-expected jobs report.
US Dollar Index increases 0.22% to 104.7 but fails to curb Gold’s advance.

Gold’s price remains range-bound and advanced on Wednesday, making a U-turn to Tuesday’s price action following the release of mixed US economic data that could warrant lower borrowing costs set by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). Therefore, US Treasury yields dropped, and the Greenback rose, yet failed to put a lid on the yellow metal. The XAU/USD trades at $2,353, up 1.18%.
The US 10-year benchmark note coupon added to its weekly losses as it went down three basis points to 4.297%, its lowest level since April, following a softer-than-expected US jobs report.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed the US economy continues to expand in its service sector, boosting both the Greenback and the golden metal.
The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback’s performance against a basket of six currencies, rises 0.22% to 104.7.
US yields continued to edge lower due to investors beginning to price in more than a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut toward the end of 2024. Via data from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), specifically the December 2024 fed funds futures contract, traders project 37 bps of easing.
The golden metal was also boosted by commodity prices stabilizing following Tuesday's plunge, which witnessed a more than 4% drop during the first two days of the week. Additionally, upbeat Caixin PMI data from China hints that the economy might continue to grow.
Consequently, US Treasury bond yields dropped, and the Greenback extended its losses to three straight days. The US 10-year Treasury bond yields plunged eleven basis points to 4.392%.

US ISM Services PMI in May expanded by 53.8 to its highest level since August 2023, exceeding estimates of 50.8 and April’s 49.4.
“Survey respondents indicated that overall business is increasing, with growth rates continuing to vary by company and industry,” wrote Anthony Nieves, ISM Services Business Survey Committee Chair.
ADP Employment Change revealed that private US hiring in May rose by 152K, below estimates of 175K and missing April’s 188K.
Last week, the US Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE), the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, stabilized, boosting hopes for potential rate cuts.
Traders are currently pricing about a 57.4% chance of a rate cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
The US economic docket during the week will feature Initial Jobless Claims for the previous week on Thursday, followed by May’s Nonfarm Payrolls on Friday.

Technical analysis: Gold price shrugs off strong US Dollar and edges higher above $2,350
Gold’s uptrend remains in place yet consolidates within the $2,320 to $2,360 area, with neither buyers nor sellers able to push prices beyond the boundaries. Momentum suggests that buyers are in charge, as portrayed by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which could pave the way for a bullish continuation.
In that event, Gold’s first resistance would be $2,360. Once cleared, the next stop would be $2,400, followed by the year-to-date high of $2,450.
Conversely, if XAU/USD drops below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $2,337, the next stop would be the May 8 low of $2,303, followed by the May 3 cycle low of $2,277.

115,"June 05, 2024",No title found,"Gold strengthens on the back of a decline in global interest-rate expectations. 
Overall weaker growth and cooler inflation in many countries is indicating central banks are about to start cutting interest rates.
This is positive for non-yielding Gold, which tends to appreciate when interest rates fall. 

Gold (XAU/USD) is trading in a mini-range in the $2,340s and is showing a daily gain of almost a percent on Wednesday. A string of poor economic data releases from the US have increased bets the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates before the end of the year, and at a global level inflation is falling and several central banks are preparing to cut interest rates This lowers the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding Gold, making it overall more attractive to investors. 
At the same time, a surprise increase in the US ISM Services PMI data, released Wednesday, suggests activity in the sector remains solid, and provides an antidote to the run of negative data the US has experienced of late. The ISM Services PMI rose to 53.8 in May, from 49.4 previously when an increase to only 50.8 had been forecast by economists. 
The gains were mainly driven by a rise in New Orders which rose to 54.1 from 52.2 in April, whilst the Prices Paid component moderated down to 58.1 from 59.2 respectively, suggesting a slight easing in high Services inflation. 
Gold edges higher as rate cuts loom
Gold drifts higher on Wednesday as more incoming macroeconomic data indicates the global economy is cooling and interest rates might be set to fall. 
Eurozone factory-gate prices fell by 1.0% in April month-over-month, Producer Price Index (PPI) data from Eurostat showed on Wednesday. The result was lower than the 0.5% decline expected by economists and the revised 0.5% fall in the previous month. Although lower energy prices were responsible for the decline, other core costs also cooled, such as non-durables, which slowed to 0.1% from 0.6% previously. 
Inflation data has been generally undershooting globally. Friday’s US core PCE data missed expectations and Swiss inflation similarly missed the mark on Tuesday, after coming out at 0.3% month-over-month in May when economists had estimated a 0.4% rise. 
In Australia, first quarter GDP growth data out on Wednesday undershot estimates of 0.2% MoM and 1.2% YoY, coming out at 0.1% and 1.1% respectively instead.  
US JOLTS Job openings data out Tuesday showed a sharp fall below estimates, coming out at 8.059 million when 8.340 million had been expected, and was well below the 8.355 million in March. The data suggested the US labor market is “further normalizing,” according to Thomas Ryan, North America Economist at Capital Economics. 
ADP Employment Change data in May, meanwhile, which measures labor market trends in the private sector, came out at 152K missing estimates of 173K from a revised down 188K. 
Several central banks are tipped to lower interest rates in June, including the European Central Bank (ECB) – which holds its meeting on Thursday –, the Bank of Canada (BoC) – which holds its meeting today (Wednesday) – and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which will meet later in June. The trend supports Gold. 
Gold short-term bearish but fundamentals solid – TD Securities
Despite a firm fundamental backdrop supporting Gold, Ryan McKay, Senior Commodity Strategist at TD Securities is bearish in the short-term. 
“Trend signals in Gold are no longer unilaterally pointing to the upside, and in fact, CTAs have become modest sellers in the yellow metal amid the recent correction in prices. However, this deterioration in short-term trend signals is expected to remain contained with a large margin of safety still remaining before the next selling trigger at the $2,209/oz mark,” says McKay. 
The negative short-term bias is balanced, however, by solid Asian demand for the purposes of currency hedging, especially against the US Dollar. 
“We see Gold on a solid footing as our tracking of trading activity in Chinese Gold ETFs suggest inflows have resumed at the fastest pace since the epic buying activity that hit the tapes in April,” says McKay. “Precious metals have increasingly morphed into a currency depreciation hedge, with resumed pressures in Asia pointing to nascent signs of notable buying activity,” he adds.
Technical Analysis: Gold trades along 50-day SMA
Gold price is trading in a mini-range over the last four to five days around the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) which is acting as a kind of tether. 
XAU/USD’s break below a major trendline, however, might have ushered in a short-term downtrend, which given “the trend is your friend” could extend. 
XAU/USD Daily Chart

The break below the trendline generated downside targets. The length of the move prior to a break can be used as a guide to the follow-through move after a break, according to technical analysis. In the case of Gold, the prior move is labeled “a” and the follow-through “b”. 
The first target for the follow-through is at $2,303, which is the 0.618 Fibonacci extrapolation of “a”.
Gold could even fall to $2,272-$2,279, the 100% extrapolation of “a” and the end of “b”. This also happens to be an area of historical support (red line). 
The precious metal’s medium and long-term trends, however, are still bullish and the risk of a recovery remains high. That said, price action is not supporting a resumption hypothesis at the moment. 
A break above $2,362 (May 29 high) would be required to bring into doubt the integrity of the short-term downtrend, otherwise further weakness is foreseen. 


Economic Indicator


ISM Services PMI
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released on a monthly basis, is a leading indicator gauging business activity in the US services sector, which makes up most of the economy. The indicator is obtained from a survey of supply executives across the US based on information they have collected within their respective organizations. Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. A reading above 50 indicates that the services economy is generally expanding, a bullish sign for the US Dollar (USD). A reading below 50 signals that services sector activity is generally declining, which is seen as bearish for USD.

Why it matters to traders?
The Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) reveals the current conditions in the US service sector, which has historically been a large GDP contributor. A print above 50 shows expansion in the service sector’s economic activity. Stronger-than-expected readings usually help the USD gather strength against its rivals. In addition to the headline PMI, the Employment Index and the Prices Paid Index numbers are also watched closely by investors as they provide useful insights regarding the state of the labour market and inflation.

Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price treads water amid USD uptick

The US Dollar staged a modest bounce from over a two-month low touched on Tuesday and exerted downward pressure on the Comex Gold price, though dismal US macro data helped limit losses. 
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that job openings fell more than expected, by 296K to 8.059 million in April, or the lowest in more than three years.
This follows the disappointing release of the US ISM Manufacturing PMI on Monday, which showed a surprising weakness in business activity and pointed to signs of a cooling US economy.
Meanwhile, there is a risk that the US economy might be softening more than anticipated cemented bets for a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve, dragging the US Treasury bond yields lower.
The rate-sensitive two-year US government bond and the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield languish near a two-week low, capping the USD and lending support to the non-yielding yellow metal. 
Traders now look forward to Wednesday's US economic docket, featuring the release of the ADP report on private-sector employment and the ISM Services PMI to grab short-term opportunities.
The focus, however, remains glued to the official monthly employment data, popularly known as the Nonfarm Payrolls report, which will determine the next leg of a directional move for the XAU/USD.

 


Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

US Treasury yields fall seven basis points, but the Greenback gains marginally, with the DXY up 0.04% to 104.08.
US JOLTS data hit three-year low, showing economic slowdown alongside below-estimate Durable Goods Orders.

Gold prices retreat some 0.90% in the mid-North American session on Tuesday, amid a risk-off impulse and despite falling US Treasury bond yields. The latest tranche of US economic data shows the economy is slowing down, warranting lower interest rates. Despite that, the XAU/USD trades with losses and exchanges hands at $2,328.
The golden metal has fallen below $2,350 a troy ounce as commodities plunges across the board. Oil prices were under heavy pressure earlier amidst fears that the global economy might grow at a slower pace, which could dent demand for crude.
US Treasury yields, which usually correlate inversely to Gold prices, were also down seven basis points by the US 10-year Treasury yield.
In opposition, the Greenback is trading with marginal gains of 0.04% in the US Dollar Index (DXY). The DXY tracks the Greenback against a basket of six currencies and is up at 104.08.
Data-wise, the US economic docket featured the release of April’s JOLTS data and Durable Goods Orders. The reports showcased that the economy remains resilient yet weak amid higher borrowing costs set by the US Federal Reserve (Fed).
Following the data release, the December 2024 fed funds rate futures contract showed that most traders expect at least 36 basis points of rate cuts via the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).
Consequently, US Treasury bond yields dropped, and the Greenback extended its losses to three straight days.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price falls as US Treasury yields retreat

Tuesday’s US economic docket featured the US JOLTs Job Openings report, which decreased from 8.355 million to 8.059 million in April, falling short of the estimated 8.34 million.
US Durable Goods Orders rose by 0.6% MoM in April, which is below both the estimates and the previous reading of 0.7%.
Last week, the US Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE), the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, stabilized, boosting hopes for potential rate cuts.
Meanwhile, business activity showed mixed results, with the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI expanding, while the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI contracted for the second consecutive month.
Traders are currently pricing about a 54.9% chance of a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
The US economic docket during the week will feature ADP Employment Change ahead of Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls.

Technical analysis: Gold price slips below $2,350
Gold’s rally remains in place, though the spot prices have fallen below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $2,334. Price action and the momentum shifting in favor of the sellers could pave the way for a pullback. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) turned bearish, below the 50 midline, opening the door for further Gold losses.
Once the XAU/USD fell below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,334, that could pave the way to challenge the May 8 low of $2,303, followed by the May 3 cycle low of $2,277.
Further gains lie ahead if XAU/USD buyers reclaim $2,350. Up next would be the $2,400 level, followed by the year-to-date high of $2,450 and, subsequently, the $2,500 mark.

119,"June 04, 2024",No title found,"Gold is falling in line with a bearish short-term technical picture and a US Dollar bounce. 
Lower global inflation expectations are prompting investors to rotate into bonds, possibly draining investment away from Gold. 
XAU/USD technicals indicate the potential for more downside following a recent trendline break. 

Gold (XAU/USD) trades over a percent lower in the $2,320s on Tuesday. A bounce by the US Dollar (USD) – which is negatively correlated to Gold – could be partly responsible, as could asset rotation into bonds. Commodities in general are trading lower, and the move is in line with Gold technicals which are short-term bearish. 
This week is big for US jobs data and JOLTS job openings have just hit the headlines after recording a lower-than-expected 8.059 million openings in April, which was below both the 8.34M expected, and the 8.355M in March, according to data from the US Bureau of Labour Statistics. The data suggests a deterioration in the US job market. The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) labor report for May, out on Friday is the big market mover this week and the JOLTS miss is a something of a bad omen. If reflected in the NFP data it could weigh on USD, supporting Gold. 
Gold weakens as broader commodity markets sell-off
The lion’s share of commodities and most equity markets are selling off on Tuesday, which – apart from idiosyncratic reasons such as the OPEC+ decision and Indian elections – seems to be a result of generalized fears about global economic growth. This seems to be due to the poor US ISM Manufacturing PMI data released on Monday. Another reason could be asset rotation as increasing numbers of investors reallocate to bonds. 
There are growing signs inflation is falling globally, with Friday’s US core PCE data undershooting estimates and Swiss inflation similarly missing the mark on Tuesday, after coming out at 0.3% month-over-month in May when economists had estimated a 0.4% rise. 
The Swiss CPI data has sparked speculation the Swiss National Bank (SNB) could make another interest rate cut at its meeting in June. With the European central Bank (ECB) highly anticipated to cut interest rates on Thursday and increasing speculation the Bank of Canada (BoC) could also cut rates on Wednesday, global bond markets are rallying and could be draining investment from Gold. 
Technical Analysis: Gold trades along 50-day SMA
Gold price is finding support at the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and consolidating after a sell-off from the May highs. 
XAU/USD has broken through a major trendline and is probably in a short-term downtrend. Given “the trend is your friend” the odds favor more weakness. 
XAU/USD Daily Chart

The trendline break generated downside targets. The length of the move prior to a break can be used as a guide to the follow-through after a break, according to technical analysis. In the case of Gold, these have been labeled “a” and “b” respectively. 
The first target is at $2,303, which is the 0.618 Fibonacci extrapolation of “a”.
Gold could even fall to $2,272-$2,279, the 100% extrapolation of “a” and the end of “b”. This also happens to be an area of historical support (red line). 
The precious metal’s medium and long-term trends, however, are still bullish and the risk of a recovery remains high. That said, price action is not supporting a resumption hypothesis at the moment. 
A break above $2,362 (May 29 high) would be required to bring into doubt the integrity ofthe short-term downtrend, otherwise further weakness is foreseen.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price fails to attract follow-through buying despite Fed rate cut bets

Signs of easing inflationary pressures and slowing economic growth lifted bets for an imminent rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year, which should continue to drive flows towards the non-yielding Comex Gold price. 
The US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported on Friday that the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index held steady at 2.7% and the core gauge rose 2.8% on a yearly basis, matching expectations.
Data published on Monday showed that the US Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7 in May from the 49.2 previous, led by a slump in new goods orders by the most in nearly two years.
This, in turn, triggered a fresh leg down in the US Treasury bond yields, dragging yields on the rate-sensitive two-year US government bond and the benchmark 10-year note to their lowest level since May 21.
The US Dollar slides to its lowest level since April 10, which, along with geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, could offer additional support to the safe-haven XAU/USD and support prospects for some upside. 
Traders now look forward to the US economic docket, featuring the release of JOLTS Job Openings and Factory Orders data for short-term opportunities later during the early North American session this Tuesday. 
The attention will then turn to the US ADP report on private-sector employment scheduled on Wednesday, which will be followed by the official jobs data, popularly known as the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday

Technical analysis: Gold price climbs and hovers at $2,350
Gold price uptrend remains intact after bouncing off the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,331. Momentum shifted in favor of the buyers, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained above the 50 midline, opening the door for further Gold’s upside.
Further gains lie ahead if XAU/USD buyers reclaim the $2,400 level, followed by the year-to-date high of $2,450 and, subsequently, the $2,500 mark.
Conversely, if XAU/USD falls below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,331, that could pave the way to challenge the May 8 low of $2,303, followed by the May 3 cycle low of $2,277.




Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

123,"June 03, 2024",No title found,"Gold recovers from three-week lows after negative US ISM Manufacturing data and fall in US yields. 
Asian demand and cooling inflation expectations further support Gold's bounce. 
Technicals remain bearish after a breakout from a Bear Flag. 

Gold (XAU/USD) recovers to trade in the $2,340s on Monday after the release of US ISM Manufacturing PMI data shows a greater-than-expected contraction in May, increasing bets the Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower interest rates as the US economy cools.
The ISM Manufacturing PMI contracted to 48.7 in May, which was below the 49.6 expected and 49.2 in April, according to data from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM)., released on Monday The data led to a increase in market-based probabilities the Fed will cut interest rates in September. Prior to the release, the CME FedWatch tool had given the chances of a September cut about 55% and after the release that had risen to 59%.   
The expectation of lower interest rates is positive for Gold as it reduces the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal. 
Gold to be supported during the summer 
Gold is likely to be supported during the summer as investors weigh the odds of future interest rate moves from major central banks and Asian demand stays bouyant, according to Bart Malek, Head of Commodity Strategy at TD Securities. 
Whilst Gold tumbled from all-time highs in April after the Fed signaled it would be delaying expected interest-rate cuts indefinitely, it has found a floor as speculators have short-covered following a poor run of US data including Friday’s core PCE undershoot. Thus the metal is both capped and supported, suggests the strategist. 
“Considering that the Fed's favorite inflation measure is showing a consistent move lower, the Gold market should be well supported through the summer. But, since policy makers will need more proof that their economic modeling is reflecting reality and that rates are indeed restrictive sufficiently to control inflation, no large rally is expected for now. Gold moves and investor positioning will very much be data dependent,” says Malek. 
Gold is further supported by Asian buying as a hedge against currency depreciation. Most recently Chinese buying has been noted as a counter-weight against the devaluation of the Renminbi, adds Malek.
Technical Analysis: Gold makes lower lows
Gold price broke out of a rectangular consolidation (red-shaded area in the chart below) – probably a Bear Flag continuation price pattern – on May 29. Bear flags are like upside-down flags with a steep decline – the “flagpole” – followed by a rectangle or square price consolidation – the “flag square”.
The breakout of the flag square activated the Bear Flag’s downside target at $2,295 (the 0.618 Fibonacci extrapolation of the flagpole that formed from May 21-23). 
The target for the break below the trendline lies nearby at $2,303 (the 0.618 Fib. extrapolation of the down-move prior to the break).
Gold has step-declined to lower lows since then, providing further bearish confirmation following the breakout. Recently bears managed to push the price down to $2,314, only $11 away from the first downside target. 
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

Gold's 4-hour chart now exhibits a sequence of declining peaks and troughs and a major trendline break, suggesting the precious metal is in a short-term downtrend and favoring short positions over longs. 
More bearish moves could very well be on the way, suggesting Gold could even fall to $2,272-$2,277 (the 100% extrapolatin of the move prior to the trend-line break, historical support and resistance). 
The precious metal’s medium and long-term trends are still bullish, however, and the risk of a recovery remains high. That said, price action is not supporting a resumption hypothesis at the moment. 
A break above the peak of the rectangular consolidation zone at $2,362 would be required to bring into doubt the integrity of the short-term downtrend, otherwise further weakness is foreseen.

Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price struggles to lure buyers despite softer US Dollar

The US inflation report was in line with estimates and reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, which is undermining the US Dollar and acting as a tailwind for the Comex Gold price. 
The US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported on Friday that the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 0.3% in April and held steady at 2.7% on a yearly basis, matching consensus estimates.
The Core PCE Price Index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also matched expectations, and rose 2.8% on a yearly basis, while Personal Income and Personal Spending grew 0.3% and 0.2% respectively. 
The data lifts bets for an imminent Fed rate cut this year and leads to a further decline in the US Treasury bond yields, keeping the USD bulls on the defensive and lending support to the non-yielding yellow metal. 
Adding to this, tensions surrounding the Middle East turn out to be another factor limiting the downside for the safe-haven XAU/USD, though a generally positive tone around the equity markets should cap the upside. 
China's Caixin S&P Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.7 in May from 51.4 previous and pointed to signs of stabilization in the world's second-largest economy, boosting investors' confidence. 
Furthermore, the latest optimism over a new ceasefire plan for Gaza announced by US President Joe Biden is holding back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the commodity. 
Market participants now look forward to the release of the final global Manufacturing PMI prints for short-term trading opportunities ahead of the US ISM Manufacturing PMI later during the day. 
Investors this week will also confront important US macro releases, including the NFP report and key central bank event risks – the BoC policy decision on Wednesday, followed by the ECB meeting on Thursday.

126,"June 02, 2024",No title found,"Gold price trades softer around $2,325 in Monday’s early Asian session. 
The US PCE price index was not sufficient to prompt the Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut, weighing on the yellow metal. 
Israeli Prime Minister begrudgingly accepted the US President's plan for a ceasefire in Gaza on Sunday.

Gold price (XAU/USD) edges lower to $2,325 on Monday during the early Asian trading hours. The yellow metal trims gains after the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data for April showed price pressures cooled in April. Meanwhile, the ongoing Middle East geopolitical risks might provide some support to gold, traditional safe-haven assets. 

The recent US PCE inflation report was not sufficient to prompt a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut, and the central bank might need some time to achieve its goal. Investors initially anticipated the first rate cut to come in March, but it got pushed to September. This, in turn, weighs on the precious metal as it increases the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset. 

The US PCE price index rose 0.3% MoM in April, while the annual PCE figure increased 2.7% YoY. Both figures came in as expected, according to the Commerce Department, on Friday. Meanwhile, the Core PCE, excluding volatile food and energy, advanced 0.2% MoM in April as compared to a 0.3% gain in March. On an annual basis, the core PCE price index climbed 2.8% for the third consecutive month.

On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration reluctantly agreed to President Biden's proposal for a Gaza cease-fire. The negotiations take place as the attack in Rafah continues after intensive Israeli airstrikes over the weekend, per the BBC. Investors will monitor the developments surrounding the geopolitical tensions. Any signs of escalating risks could boost safe-haven flows, benefiting the gold price.

127,"May 31, 2024",No title found,"Gold reverses the gains made after the release of PCE inflation data shows price pressures cooled in April. 
Precious metal already made gains following the second estimate for US Q1 GDP which showed the economy expanded less than previously anticipated. 
Gold remains technically vulnerable after a breakout from the Bear Flag continuation pattern. 

Gold (XAU/USD) slumps back into the $2,330s on Friday undoing the gains it made after the release of US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data for April, which showed cooling core price pressures. The PCE is the Federal Reserve's (Fed) prefered gauge of inflation and Core PCE cooled to 0.2% month-over-month, from 0.3% previously, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Analysts had expected Core PCE to remain unchanged at 0.3%. 
The rest of the PCE data came out in line with analysts estimates, however, the undershoot in Core PCE revealed inflation cooling in the US more quickly than analysts expected. This, as a consequence, increased the likelihood of the Fed cutting interest rates sooner rather than later. Lower interest rates tend to be positive for Gold as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset and the precious metal rose after the data. 
The gains came on the back of a recovery that started on Thursday after the release of weaker US growth data, suggested inflation would remain contained, also leading to lower interest rate projections.
As traders wrap up for the weekend, however, Gold is pulling back down and may even end the day in the negative. 
Gold recovers after US growth slows
Gold rebounded on Thursday after the second estimate of US first-quarter GDP growth showed a downward revision to an annualized 1.3% from 1.6% in the first estimate. 
The slower growth came from lower consumer spending, which in turn is expected to keep inflation contained, and the Federal Reserve (Fed) on track to lower interest rates. In a reflection of changing expectations after the GDP release, the US 10-year Treasury Note yield dropped back to 4.55% from a four-week peak of 4.63%. 
The probabilities of the Fed cutting interest rates before September are insignificant but stand at 55% for a cut in September, data from the CME FedWatch Tool shows. 
Gold and Asian demand as a currency hedge
US interest-rate expectations are not the only factor influencing the Gold price, according to Daniel Ghali, a Senior Commodity Strategist at TD Securities. 
Ghali’s research shows that Gold demand is being driven by Asian buyers who are hoarding the precious metal as a hedge as their currencies depreciate against a strengthening US Dollar (USD).  
“Precious metals are acting as a currency depreciation hedge. Case in point: fund flows into Chinese gold ETFs are rising once more at their fastest pace since the massive buying activity observed in April. US yields are surging, the dollar broke out of its lull, and yet precious metals prices have remained extremely resilient,” says Ghali. 
This suggests the strength of the US Dollar may not be as negatively correlated to Gold as it was in the past, and Gold prices could be capped in the event of an appreciation of USD. 
Technical Analysis: Gold poised for weakness after breakout from Bear Flag 
Gold price has broken out of a slanted rectangular formation (red-shaded area), probably a Bear Flag continuation price pattern which formed between May 24 and 27. 
The breakout activates the Bear Flag’s downside target zone of between $2,303 and $2,295. A break below Thursday’s $2,322 lows would provide further bearish confirmation. 
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

Bear Flags look like upside-down flags composed of a sharp decline – the flagpole – and the consolidation phase or “flag square”. 
A more bearish move could even see Gold fall to $2,272-$2,277 (the 100% extrapolation of the move prior to the trend-line break and historic support and resistance). 
Gold's 4-hour chart, used to assess the short-term trend, now exhibits a sequence of declining peaks and troughs, suggesting it is in a short-term downtrend and favoring short positions over longs. 
The precious metal’s medium and long-term trends are still bullish, however, suggesting the risk of a recovery remains high. That said, price action is not supporting a resumption hypothesis at the moment. 
A decisive break back above the trendline, now at around $2,385, would be required to provide evidence of a recovery and reversal of the short-term downtrend. 
A decisive break would be one accompanied by a long green bullish candle or three green candles in a row.  


Economic Indicator


Core Personal Consumption Expenditures - Price Index (YoY)
The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), released by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis on a monthly basis, measures the changes in the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers in the United States (US). The PCE Price Index is also the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred gauge of inflation. The YoY reading compares the prices of goods in the reference month to the same month a year earlier. The core reading excludes the so-called more volatile food and energy components to give a more accurate measurement of price pressures."" Generally, a high reading is bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is bearish.

Why it matters to traders?
After publishing the GDP report, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis releases the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index data alongside the monthly changes in Personal Spending and Personal Income. FOMC policymakers use the annual Core PCE Price Index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, as their primary gauge of inflation. A stronger-than-expected reading could help the USD outperform its rivals as it would hint at a possible hawkish shift in the Fed’s forward guidance and vice versa.

Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

130,"May 31, 2024",No title found,"Gold price trades with a mild positive bias on Friday. 
The weaker USD and decline of US yields support the yellow metal. 
Investors will take more cues from the US April PCE inflation data, which is due on Friday. 

Gold price (XAU/USD) advances modestly on Friday on the back of the softer US dollar (USD) and lower US yields. Traders place higher bets that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut the interest rate this year after the recent weaker US GDP data. Furthermore, the geopolitical risks and conflicts in the Middle East might boost the precious metal as it is perceived as a traditional safe-haven asset. 

Later on Friday, gold traders will keep an eye on the US April Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (Core PCE), the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. The Core PCE figure is projected to show an increase of 0.3% MoM and 2.8% YoY in April.  In case of the hotter-than-expected inflation data, this might provide some support to the Greenback and cap the upside for gold price. 
Daily Digest Market Movers: Gold price rises amid geopolitical risks and weaker US GDP  

Israel is in effective control of Gaza’s entire land border after taking control of a buffer zone along the border with Egypt, Israel’s military has said, a move that may complicate its ties with Egypt, per the Guardian. 
The second estimate of US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed the economy expanded at an annualized pace of 1.3% in Q1 from 1.6% in the previous reading, in line with market expectations. 
The US weekly Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending May 25 rose to 219K from the previous week of 216K, above the market consensus of 218K. 
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Thursday that housing inflation remains a key sticking point in price growth and that the US labor market remains quite strong.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that central bankers are unlikely to deliver an interest rate cut in July amid signs that inflation progress has slowed. 
New York Fed President John Williams noted that inflation is still too high, but he is confident it will start decelerating later this year, per CNBC. 

 Technical analysis: Gold price remains positive on the daily timeframe
The gold price posts modest gains on the day. Technically, the yellow metal maintains the bullish picture as it is above the key 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Nonetheless, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around the 50-midline, suggesting a lack of direction for gold price and further consolidation looks favourable. 

The upper boundary of the Bollinger Band near $2,425 acts as an immediate resistance level for precious metal. Any follow-through buying will see a rally to the all-time high of $2,450 en route to the $2,500 psychological barrier. 

On the other hand, the key contention level will emerge at the $2,290–$2,300 region, portraying the lower limit of the Bollinger Band and the round mark. A decisive break below this level will drag the yellow metal lower to the 100-day EMA of $2,230.

Interest rates FAQs


 What are interest rates? 
Interest rates are charged by financial institutions on loans to borrowers and are paid as interest to savers and depositors. They are influenced by base lending rates, which are set by central banks in response to changes in the economy. Central banks normally have a mandate to ensure price stability, which in most cases means targeting a core inflation rate of around 2%. If inflation falls below target the central bank may cut base lending rates, with a view to stimulating lending and boosting the economy. If inflation rises substantially above 2% it normally results in the central bank raising base lending rates in an attempt to lower inflation.



 How do interest rates impact currencies? 
Higher interest rates generally help strengthen a country’s currency as they make it a more attractive place for global investors to park their money.



 How do interest rates influence the price of Gold? 
Higher interest rates overall weigh on the price of Gold because they increase the opportunity cost of holding Gold instead of investing in an interest-bearing asset or placing cash in the bank. If interest rates are high that usually pushes up the price of the US Dollar (USD), and since Gold is priced in Dollars, this has the effect of lowering the price of Gold.



 What is the Fed Funds rate? 
The Fed funds rate is the overnight rate at which US banks lend to each other. It is the oft-quoted headline rate set by the Federal Reserve at its FOMC meetings. It is set as a range, for example 4.75%-5.00%, though the upper limit (in that case 5.00%) is the quoted figure. Market expectations for future Fed funds rate are tracked by the CME FedWatch tool, which shapes how many financial markets behave in anticipation of future Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions.

Slower US GDP growth and rising unemployment claims weaken the Greenback.
Traders eye April’s PCE inflation data, which could dictate XAU/USD’s direction.

Gold prices trimmed some of Wednesday’s losses and rose 0.41% on Thursday after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed the economy is slowing, reigniting hopes that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) may cut rates later in the year.
The XAU/USD trades at $2,347, bouncing off daily lows of $2,322. The yield of the US 10-year note collapsed almost seven basis points (bps) to 4.548%, while the Greenback followed suit. The US Dollar Index (DXY) lost 0.43%, at 104.67.
The US economy grew at a slower rate than in the fourth quarter of last year, indicating that higher borrowing costs set by the Fed are taking their toll on the economy. Meanwhile, the US Department of Labor revealed an increase in the number of people applying for unemployment benefits.
Recently, New York Fed President John Williams grabbed the headlines. He said that monetary policy is well-positioned, that inflation is too high, and that he doesn’t feel urgency to slash interest rates. He added that inflation would reach the Fed’s 2% goal in early 2026.
Even though he was hawkish, Gold prices barely heeded his words, standing at current spot prices. The US housing market is also weakening, according to the Pending Home Sales data revealed by the National Association of Realtors.
Ahead in the week, traders are anticipating the release of April’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, which is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation. The core PCE figure is expected to be 2.8% YoY, while the headline PCE is projected to increase by 0.3% MoM.

Fed funds rate futures estimate just 27 basis points of interest rate cuts in 2024, according to data provided by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).

Technical analysis: Gold price climbs, yet remains below $2,350
Gold’s rally is set to continue, yet buyers are struggling to crack the psychological $2,350 mark, which could pave the way for further gains. Short-term momentum favors sellers as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains bearish after punching below the 50 midline on Wednesday.
Further gains could be anticipated if XAU/USD buyers reclaim the psychological mark of $2,350. The next target would be the $2,400 level, followed by the year-to-date high of $2,450 and, subsequently, the $2,500 mark.
Conversely, if XAU/USD falls below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,321, that could pave the way to challenge the May 8 low of $2,303, followed by the May 3 cycle low of $2,277.




Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.







Economic Indicator


Core Personal Consumption Expenditures - Price Index (YoY)
The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), released by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis on a monthly basis, measures the changes in the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers in the United States (US). The PCE Price Index is also the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred gauge of inflation. The YoY reading compares the prices of goods in the reference month to the same month a year earlier. The core reading excludes the so-called more volatile food and energy components to give a more accurate measurement of price pressures."" Generally, a high reading is bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is bearish.

Why it matters to traders?
After publishing the GDP report, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis releases the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index data alongside the monthly changes in Personal Spending and Personal Income. FOMC policymakers use the annual Core PCE Price Index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, as their primary gauge of inflation. A stronger-than-expected reading could help the USD outperform its rivals as it would hint at a possible hawkish shift in the Fed’s forward guidance and vice versa.

132,"May 30, 2024",No title found,"Gold price recoups earlier losses after US GDP data for Q1 is revised lower.
The precious metal was weakening on a higher interest-rate outlook, increasing the opportunity cost of holding Gold. 
Gold breaks out of its Bear Flag pattern and starts declining towards its bearish targets. 

Gold (XAU/USD) recovers and trades in the $2,340s on Thursday after the US Dollar (USD), to which it is negatively correlated, weakens following the release of the second estimate of US GDP data, which was revised down due to slower consumer spending. 
Annualized US GDP growth in Q1 was revised down to 1.3% from a first estimate of 1.6%, according to data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, released on Thursday. The reading was below the 3.4% in Q4 but in line with analysts' expectations. The data led to a fall in US Treasury yields which are negatively correlated to Gold.  
The GDP data suggests the US economy is not as strong as analysts had previously thought, and could indicate declining inflation, which in turn might lead the Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower interest rates – a positive for Gold since lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal. 
Gold remains pressured on interest-rate outlook, European inflation 
Gold remains vulnerable, however, due to commentary from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials suggesting that US interest rates are set to remain high, and higher-than-expected inflation readings in Europe. 
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari surprised markets on Tuesday when he said Fed officials had not disregarded hiking interest rates. He then added that if the Fed did cut borrowing costs, it would be twice toward the end of 2024.
Meanwhile, German and Spanish inflation data showed higher-than-expected readings in Europe, which reduces the probability that the European Central Bank (ECB) will follow their widely publicized June interest rate cut with a string of further cuts.
The preliminary Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany rose by 2.8% year-over-year in May, beating economists’ expectations of 2.7% and the previous 2.4% reading, data from Eurostat showed on Wednesday.  
According to data released on Thursday, the preliminary HICP in Spain rose by 3.8% in May, beating the 3.7% forecast and well above the 3.4% of the previous month. 
The German and Spanish data suggest that Eurozone-wide HICP will also show an above-consensus reading when released on Friday. This could prompt the ECB to put the breaks on lowering interest rates in order to manage persistent inflationary pressures. 
Technical Analysis: Gold breaks out of Bear Flag 
Gold price has broken out of a rectangular formation (red-shaded area in the chart below), which is probably a Bear Flag continuation price pattern formed between May 24 and 27. 
Bear Flags look like upside-down flags composed of a sharp decline – the flagpole – and the consolidation phase or flag square. 
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

The breakout from the Bear Flag continuation pattern suggests a substantial downside to a target zone between $2,303 and $2,295. A break below Thursday’s $2,322 lows would provide bearish confirmation. 
Last week’s decisive break below the major trend line provides the first target at $2,303 (the Fibonacci 0.618 extrapolation of the down move prior to the break). The second target is the 0.618 Fibonacci extension of the flagpole (move down between May 21 and 24).
A more bearish move could see Gold fall to $2,272 (the 100% extrapolation of the move prior to the trend-line break). 
Gold's 4-hour chart, used to assess the short-term trend, exhibits a sequence of declining peaks and troughs. It is likely to be in a short-term downtrend now, favoring short positions over longs. 
The precious metal’s medium and long-term trends are still bullish, however, suggesting the risk of a recovery remains high, yet price action is not supporting a resumption hypothesis at the moment. 
A decisive break back above the trendline, now at around $2,385, would be required to provide evidence of a recovery and reversal of the short-term downtrend. 
A decisive break would be one accompanied by a long green bullish candle or three green candles in a row.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) fell on Thursday, according to FXStreet data. Silver trades at $31.43 per troy ounce, down 1.69% from the $31.97 it cost on Wednesday.
Silver prices have increased by 23.40% since the beginning of the year.

The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of troy ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one troy ounce of Gold, stood at 74.25 on Thursday, up from 73.13 on Wednesday.
Investors might use this ratio to determine the relative valuation of Gold and Silver. Some may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued – or Gold is overvalued – and might buy Silver or sell Gold accordingly. Conversely, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.



Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

The upside of yellow metal might be limited amid the diminishing bets of a rate cut in September from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) Nonetheless, the safe-haven flows amid the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East might lift the gold price. 

Gold investors will take more cues from Fedspeak. The Fed’s Waller is set to speak on Friday. The hawkish remarks from the Fed policymakers might further weigh on the yellow metal. It’s worth noting that a higher rate generally hurts gold prices as it increases the opportunity cost of investing in the yellow metal. Apart from this, the US Durable Goods Order and Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index will be released. 


Daily Digest Market Movers: Gold price retreats from record highs amid the Fed’s hawkish remarks

The US Initial Jobless Claims fell by 8K to 215K for the week ending May 18. This figure came in lower than the expectation of 220K and the previous week's reading of 223K.
The flash US S&P Global Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.9 in May from 50.0 in April. The Services PMI climbed to 54.8 in May from the previous reading of 51.3. Both figures came in better than the estimation. 
The US S&P Global Composite PMI jumped to 54.4 in May from 51.3 in April, beating the market expectation of 51.1, the highest level since April 2022.

China’s private sector imported 543 tonnes of gold in Q1 2024, and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) added another 189 tonnes to its reserves during the same period, according to the latest analysis by Gainesville Coins’ Jan Nieuwenhuijs.
Gold imports to India, the world's second-largest gold consumer, might decline by about a fifth in 2024 as high prices encourage retail customers to exchange old jewelry for new products, per Reuters. 

Technical Analysis: Gold price’s bullish stance remains intact, with a Bearish Divergence in focus
Gold price trades on a weaker note on the day. The precious metal keeps the bullish vibe unchanged on the daily chart as it holds above the key 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). However, the yellow metal has formed a bearish divergence as the price made higher highs on May 20, but the RSI indicator has formed lower highs, suggesting the momentum is slowing, and a correction or consolidation in price cannot be ruled out. 

The upper boundary of Bollinger Band at $2,428 acts as an immediate resistance level for XAU/USD. A decisive break above this level could resume its climb to an all-time high of $2,450 en route to the $2,500 psychological barrier. 

On the flip side, the first downside target will emerge at a low of May 13 at $2,285. Extended losses could take gold lower to the lower limit of the Bollinger Band at $2,267. Further south, the next contention level is seen at the 100-period EMA of $2,217.

Fed FAQs


 What does the Federal Reserve do, how does it impact the US Dollar? 
Monetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.



 How often does the Fed hold monetary policy meetings? 
The Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials – the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.



 What is Quantitative Easing (QE) and how does it impact USD? 
In extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed’s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.



 What is Quantitative Tightening (QT) and how does it impact the US Dollar? 
Quantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar.

Strong US economic data boosts Treasury yields and US Dollar, impacting Gold prices.
Fed minutes suggest more rate hikes possible if inflation continues, rate cut expectations reduced to 27 basis points by end of 2024.
Emerging market central banks have acquired 2,200 tons of gold since Q3 2022, influenced by sanctions on Russia.

Gold price tanks for the third straight day on Thursday, refreshing one-week lows after economic data from the United States spurred a jump in US Treasury yields and boosted the American Dollar. That hurt the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate cut hopes with investors expecting just 27 basis points of easing toward the end of 2024, based on Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) data.
At the time of writing, the XAU/USD trades at $2,332, plunging 1.90% after reaching a high of $2,383.
US business activity is gathering pace, revealed S&P Global on its May final reading of the Manufacturing, Services, and Composite PMIs. Earlier, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits was shy of estimates and less than the previous reading, indicating strength in the labor market.
The data boosted the Greenback, which, according to the US Dollar Index (DXY), gained 0.18% and is back above 105.00. In addition, the Fed Minutes revealed on Wednesday showed that some officials were ready to raise rates if inflation warranted, a headwind for the non-yielding metal.
Gold prices were underpinned by emerging markets' central bank buying, according to an article in The Wall Street Journal. The catalyst that sparked the buying was Western sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.
The World Gold Council revealed that central banks added around 2,200 tons of the golden metal since Q3 2022.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price falls as US yields climbed following upbeat US PMIs

Gold prices are undermined by the rise in US Treasury yields. The US 10-year Treasury note yield edges up five basis points to 4.477%, a headwind for the yellow metal.
Initial Jobless Claims in the US reached 215K for the week ending May 18, which was lower than the estimated 220K and the previous week's reading of 223K.
S&P Global released the final US PMI readings for May. The Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.9, surpassing both estimates and April's figure of 50.0. The Services PMI significantly outperformed forecasts and April's 51.3, increasing to 54.8.
S&P Global Composite PMI also improved, climbing from 51.3 to 54.4, and exceeded the forecast of 51.1.
The FOMC Minutes showed that Fed officials remained uncertain about the degree of policy restrictiveness. They added that “it would take longer than previously anticipated to gain greater confidence in inflation moving sustainably to 2%.”
Data from the Chicago Board of Trade shows investors are expecting 27 basis points of Fed easing toward the end of the year.

Technical analysis: Gold price slides below $2,350 as bears target $2,300
Gold price remains upwardly biased despite posting losses for the third straight day. In the short term, momentum has shifted negatively. This is shown by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which dropped below the 50-midline, an indication that sellers are in charge.
That said, the XAU/USD’s first support would be the May 13 low at $2,332, followed by the May 8 low of $2,303. Once those levels are surpassed, the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,307 will be up next.
On the other hand, if buyers push prices above $2,350, the $2,400 mark could be exposed. Gold prices could rally and, on further strength, retest the year-to-date (YTD) high at $2,450.




Interest rates FAQs


 What are interest rates? 
Interest rates are charged by financial institutions on loans to borrowers and are paid as interest to savers and depositors. They are influenced by base lending rates, which are set by central banks in response to changes in the economy. Central banks normally have a mandate to ensure price stability, which in most cases means targeting a core inflation rate of around 2%. If inflation falls below target the central bank may cut base lending rates, with a view to stimulating lending and boosting the economy. If inflation rises substantially above 2% it normally results in the central bank raising base lending rates in an attempt to lower inflation.



 How do interest rates impact currencies? 
Higher interest rates generally help strengthen a country’s currency as they make it a more attractive place for global investors to park their money.



 How do interest rates influence the price of Gold? 
Higher interest rates overall weigh on the price of Gold because they increase the opportunity cost of holding Gold instead of investing in an interest-bearing asset or placing cash in the bank. If interest rates are high that usually pushes up the price of the US Dollar (USD), and since Gold is priced in Dollars, this has the effect of lowering the price of Gold.



 What is the Fed Funds rate? 
The Fed funds rate is the overnight rate at which US banks lend to each other. It is the oft-quoted headline rate set by the Federal Reserve at its FOMC meetings. It is set as a range, for example 4.75%-5.00%, though the upper limit (in that case 5.00%) is the quoted figure. Market expectations for future Fed funds rate are tracked by the CME FedWatch tool, which shapes how many financial markets behave in anticipation of future Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions.

136,"May 23, 2024",No title found,"Gold is threatening to break below a key trendline after the release of US PMI data. 
The data showed the Services and Manufacturing sectors in the US expanded more than expected in May. 
Gold’s short-term trend is bearish but it is pentrating a major trendline. 

Gold (XAU/USD) has fallen to the $2,340s on Thursday after the release of US S&P Global Purchasing Manager Index survey data showed a greater-than-expected expansion in both the Services and Manufacturing sectors in May. The data suggests interest rates will have to remain restrictively high in the US for some time before inflation can be brought sustainably down to the Federal Reserve's 2.0% target. 
The expectation that interest rates will remain at their current level (or higher) for an extended amount of time was bearish for Gold. As a non-yielding asset, higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding Gold, reducing its attractiveness to investors. 
The data comes on the back of the release of the Fed's last meeting Minutes on Wednesday, which revealed policymakers were reluctant to lower interest rates – and even discussed hiking them – due to persistent inflationary pressures. 
Gold has fallen sharply from its all-time high on Monday and is currently pentrating a major trendline on Gold price chart which if breached decisively could spell doom for Gold bulls. 
Gold price continues bearish reversal after PMI data 
Gold weakens on Thursday after the release of strong data from the US, showing its economy is in rude health. US S&P Global Manufacturing PMI came out at 50.9 in May, up from the 50.0 in April and the 50.0 forecast by economists. Services PMI, meanwhile, rose to 54.8 from 51.3 in the previous month and 51.3 forecast. Composite PMI came out at 54.4 in May, up from 51.3 in April – and beating the decline to 51.1 economists had expected. 
The higher-than-expected Services PMI data, in particular, will have supported the US Dollar (USD) as the Federal Reserve (Fed) has highlighted Services-sector inflation as a key hotspot in the economy that needs to cool down before it moves to cut interest rates. The maintenance of higher interest rates supports the USD since it attracts higher inflows of foreign capital compared to lower interest rates. 
Gold declined sharply after the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting Minutes for the April 29-May 1 policy meeting on Wednesday. 
The Minutes revealed that although policymakers expected price pressures to ease eventually, they had not fallen quickly enough to warrant a cut in the fed funds rate target range, which would remain at its 5.25% - 5.50% level “at least until September,” according to FXStreet. 
The strength of the labor market emerged as a key determining factor for future policy. The Fed’s rate-setters even discussed the possibility of raising interest rates to tackle inflation. This added a more hawkish twist to the proceedings and echoed similar discussions in the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) meeting Minutes. 
The Minutes catalyzed a rally in the US Dollar, which has a negative correlation with Gold. 
The next major release for Gold is the US Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) data for May at 13:45 GMT on Thursday. If the data is positive it could have a negative impact on Gold, and vice-versa if it is weaker.
Technical Analysis: Gold pentrates trendline
Gold price (XAU/USD) is pentrating the dark-grey major trendline which reflects the uptrend since February. 
Gold is now probably in a short-term downtrend favoring short positions over longs. If it breaks decisively below the trendline it would be an extremely bearish sign and suggest deeper declines to come.
XAU/USD Daily Chart


 
Gold price could fall to a conservative target at $2,305 (Fibonacci 0.618 of the prior down move) or all the way down to $2,275 (100% of the prior down move) in the event bears decisively breach the dark-grey trendline. 
A decisive break would be one accompanied by a long red candle that closes near its low or three red candles in a row that break below the trendline. 
The precious metal’s medium and long-term trends are still bullish, however, and given the old adage that “the trend is your friend,” this suggests the risk of a recovery remains high. At the moment the only sign a recovery may evolve is that Gold has found support at a major trendline. There are no signs from price action, however, that a reversal is underway.
A break above the new $2,450 all-time high would confirm a continuation of the uptrend and a rally to the next target, probably at the psychologically significant $2,500 level. 


Economic Indicator


S&P Global Services PMI
The S&P Global Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released on a monthly basis, is a leading indicator gauging business activity in the US services sector. As the services sector dominates a large part of the economy, the Services PMI is an important indicator gauging the state of overall economic conditions. The data is derived from surveys of senior executives at private-sector companies from the services sector. Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month and can anticipate changing trends in official data series such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), industrial production, employment and inflation. A reading above 50 indicates that the services economy is generally expanding, a bullish sign for the US Dollar (USD). Meanwhile, a reading below 50 signals that activity among service providers is generally declining, which is seen as bearish for USD.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) fell on Thursday, according to FXStreet data. Silver trades at $30.46 per troy ounce, down 1.03% from the $30.78 it cost on Wednesday.
Silver prices have increased by 19.59% since the beginning of the year.

The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of troy ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one troy ounce of Gold, stood at 77.53 on Thursday, up from 77.28 on Wednesday.
Investors might use this ratio to determine the relative valuation of Gold and Silver. Some may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued – or Gold is overvalued – and might buy Silver or sell Gold accordingly. Conversely, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

138,"May 23, 2024",No title found,"Gold price trades with a negative bias on Thursday. 
The hawkish stance of the FOMC minutes from last month's meeting might cap the precious metal’s upside. 
Investors will focus on the first reading of US PMI data for May, due on Thursday.  

Gold price (XAU/USD) attracts some sellers on Wednesday. The further upside of the yellow metal might be limited, as the FOMC minutes were interpreted as significantly more hawkish than previous releases. The cautious approach of the US Fed to hold its restrictive policy for longer boosts the Greenback broadly and exerts some selling pressure on the gold price. 

Gold traders will closely watch the preliminary reading of the US Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for May. A weaker reading might trigger hope for Fed rate cuts and support gold. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, uncertainties, and sticky inflation could support the precious metal and cap the downside in the near term. Apart from this, the Chicago Fed National Activity Index, weekly Initial Jobless Claims, New Home Sales, and Fed’s Bostic will be in focus. 
Daily Digest Market Movers: Gold price remains sensitive to the Fed’s hawkish remarks

The minutes from the recent policy meeting of the FOMC released Wednesday indicated that “participants observed that while inflation had eased over the past year, in recent months there had been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective.”
The minutes further stated that “participants assessed that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting was supported by data indicating continued solid economic growth.” 
Investors have priced in nearly a 60% chance of the first cut to happen in September and two reductions of a quarter percentage point before the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
The preliminary of US S&P Global Manufacturing and Service PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 50.0 and 51.3 in May, respectively. 
The People's Bank of China (PBoC) has been the largest buyer among its worldwide counterparts over the past year. Its addition of 225 tonnes to its gold reserves last year was the highest on record since at least 1977.

Technical Analysis: Gold price keeps the bullish outlook on the daily chart, eyes are on a Bearish Divergence
Gold price trades softer on the day. The constructive view of the yellow metal remains intact as it is above the key 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) holds above the bullish zone near 56.10, supporting the buyers for the time being. Nonetheless, XAU/USD has formed a bearish divergence as the price has moved to an all-time high on May 20, but the RSI indicator has formed lower highs, suggesting the momentum is slowing and there will likely be a correction or consolidation in price in the near term.

The key resistance level for the precious metal will emerge near the the upper boundary of Bollinger Band and an all-time high of $2,450. A break above this level will expose the $2,500 psychological round mark. 

On the downside, a low of May 13 at $2,332 acts as an initial support level for gold. The additional downside filter to watch is the lower limit of the Bollinger Band at $2,270. A breach of the mentioned level will see a drop to the 100-period EMA of $2,216.

Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

US Treasury yields rise following hotter-than-expected UK inflation data.
Wall Street Journal reports central banks in emerging markets added 2,200 tons of Gold since Q3 2022, driven by Western sanctions on Russia.
Fed minutes reveal willingness to tighten policy further if economic risks materialize.

Gold plunged during the North American session on Wednesday, breaching below the $2,400 barrier, as traders seem to have booked profits ahead of the release of the last Federal Reserve (Fed) Meeting Minutes. Data from the United States (US) showed the housing market continued to show weakness, while Fed officials remained home after a busy week’s start.
The XAU/USD trades at $2,392, losing more than 1% after reaching a high of $2,426. US Treasury bond yields are rising following a hotter-than-expected inflation report from the UK, sending US yields higher. US equities are mixed ahead of NVIDIA’s earnings report release, while the Greenback edges up.
In the meantime, an article by The Wall Street Journal mentioned that Gold rallied due to central bank buying. According to the World Gold Council, central banks in emerging markets added around 2,200 tons of the golden metal since Q3 2022.
The article mentioned that the trigger might be Western sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.
Aside from this, US Existing Home Sales plunged in April from 4.22 million to 4.14 million, or a -1.9 % contraction. Despite that, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said, “Home prices reaching a record high for the month of April is very good news for homeowners.”
Recently, the Fed released its latest meeting minutes, which showed that “Various participants mentioned willingness to tighten policy further should risks to outlook materialize and make such action appropriate.”
Daily digest market movers: Gold price falls as US yields climbed following hawkish Fed Minutes

Gold prices tumble sharply as US Treasury yields rise and Greenback advances. The US 10-year Treasury bond yield edges up 2 basis points to 4.434%, while the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback’s performance against a basket of six other currencies, is up 0.19% at 104.82, a headwind for XAU/USD.
The FOMC Minutes showed that Fed officials remained uncertain about the degree of policy restrictiveness. They added that “it would take longer than previously anticipated to gain greater confidence in inflation moving sustainably to 2%.”
During the week, speeches by Fed officials laid the ground for the “hawkish tilt” of the FOMC’s Minutes, as most officials commented they would like to be certain that inflation is edging down and that they’re not in a rush to lower the fed funds rate.
Data from the Chicago Board of Trade shows investors are expecting 31 basis points of Fed easing toward the end of the year.

Technical analysis: Gold price slides below $2,400 as bears target $2,330
Gold price’s uptrend remains in place, yet Wednesday’s pullback could pave the way to test lower prices. Momentum is shifting negatively as the Relative Strength Index (RS), despite standing bullish, is aiming downwards. With that said, buying pressure is waning as sellers step in.
That said, the XAU/USD’s first support would be the May 13 low at $2,332, followed by the May 8 low of $2,303. Once those levels are surpassed, the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,284 will be up next.
On the other hand, if buyers push the Gold price above $2,400, look for a retest of year-to-date highs at $2,450.

140,"May 22, 2024",No title found,"Gold price retreats for the second consecutive day on the back of elevated interest-rate expectations. 
Fed policymakers are expressing a reluctance to lower interest rates until more progress has been made on beating inflation. 
Their views are echoed in other parts of the globe further weighing on the Gold price which is sensitive to interest rates. 

Gold price (XAU/USD) trades lower by over a percent in the $2,380s on Wednesday after a shift in the outlook for interest rates – both in the US and globally – weighs on the precious metal. 
Recent comments from US Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers repeated the mantra that insufficient progress had been made in bringing inflation down to the Fed’s 2.0% target to warrant a lowering of interest rates. 
Their views weighed on the Gold price which, as a non-yielding asset, tends to perform poorly when interest rates are high due to the increased opportunity cost of holding Gold.
Gold price pulls back ahead of Fed Minutes  
Gold price might be further impacted when the Fed releases the FOMC Minutes from its latest policy meeting on Wednesday at 18:00 GMT. 
If the meeting minutes reflect a shift to a more hawkish stance amongst policymakers, Gold is expected to continue retreating. 
The recent Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meeting Minutes revealed that officials at the RBA had discussed the possibility of raising rates – a notable shift in stance from previous meetings. 
Technical Analysis: Gold price edges lower towards trendline support
Gold price (XAU/USD) weakens and penetrates support from the green trendline, which reflects the short-term uptrend that began at the beginning of May.
The pair formed a Shooting Star Japanese candlestick pattern (shaded rectangle on the chart) on Monday, followed by a bearish close the following day, providing additional confirmation. The pattern is indicative of short-term weakness.  
XAU/USD Daily Chart

 
If the pullback continues, Gold could fall down to the dark grey upward-sloping trendline in the $2,360s. 
However, the precious metal’s short, medium and long-term trends are bullish, and given the old adage that “the trend is your friend”, the odds favor an eventual recovery after the correction. 
A break above the new $2,450 all-time high would likely continue the rally to the next target at the psychologically significant $2,500 level. 


Economic Indicator


FOMC Minutes
FOMC stands for The Federal Open Market Committee that organizes 8 meetings in a year and reviews economic and financial conditions, determines the appropriate stance of monetary policy and assesses the risks to its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth. FOMC Minutes are released by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and are a clear guide to the future US interest rate policy.

Why it matters to traders?
Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is usually published three weeks after the day of the policy decision. Investors look for clues regarding the policy outlook in this publication alongside the vote split. A bullish tone is likely to provide a boost to the greenback while a dovish stance is seen as USD-negative. It needs to be noted that the market reaction to FOMC Minutes could be delayed as news outlets don’t have access to the publication before the release, unlike the FOMC’s Policy Statement.

Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

Gold price edges lower in Wednesday’s early European session.
The cautious approach from Fed officials weighs on precious metals. 
Gold traders will monitor the  FOMC Minutes and Fed’s Goolsbee speech. 

Gold price (XAU/USD) trades on a negative note on Wednesday after retreating from a record high on Monday. Members of the Federal Reserve (Fed) warned that the US central bank needed much more convincing that inflation was easing before it could begin cutting interest rates, emphasizing the Fed is likely to keep rates higher for longer. This, in turn, might boost the Greenback and weigh the USD-denominated gold lower. 
Nonetheless, the yellow metal’s downside might be limited amid the renewed US-China trade tensions, Middle East geopolitical tensions, and the strong demand from central banks and Asian buyers, which might provide some support to the yellow metal. Later on Wednesday, gold traders will keep an eye on FOMC Minutes, along with the Fed’s Goolsbee speech.

On Tuesday, the US officially announced tariff hikes on a wide range of Chinese goods, while China  may consider increasing temporary tariff rates on imported cars equipped with large-displacement engines. 

Technical Analysis: Gold price’s stance remains positive
Gold price attracts some sellers on the day. XAU/USD has formed an ascending trend channel since the beginning of May. Technically, the yellow metal maintains the constructive outlook unchanged as it holds above the key 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour timeframe. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in the bullish zone around 63.00, suggesting that further upside looks favorable for the time being. 

The first upside target for the precious metal will emerge near an all-time high of $2,450. A bullish breakout above this level will see a rally to the upper boundary of an ascending trend channel at $2,465, en route to the $2,500 psychological barrier. 

In the bearish case, the lower limit of the ascending trend channel and round mark in the $2,400–$2,405 zone act as an initial support level for XAU/USD. Further south, the downside target to watch is a high of May 10 of $2,378, followed by the 100-period EMA of $2,364.

US Treasury yields decline with 10-year TIPS yield dropping three basis points to 2.081%.
Hedge funds increase bullish bets on Gold futures to a three-week high, capping XAU/USD’s losses.

Gold price retraces during Tuesday’s North American session after hitting an all-time high of $2,450. Yet it retreated below the April 12 high of $2,431 as the Greenback recovers some ground. A scarce economic docket keeps traders leaning on Fedspeak, which remained cautious of signaling the beginning of rate cuts.
The XAU/USD trades at $2,418, down 0.28% after reaching a high of $2,433. Wall Street indices remain in the green, a headwind for the safe-haven status for the golden metal. Even though it’s sought as a “hedge” for inflation, investors seem reluctant to give away profits from the US stock market.
Additionally, officials of the Federal Reserve (Fed) continued to cross the wires and adhere to its stance of keeping interest rates on hold until the disinflationary process evolves.
Despite that, US Treasury bond yields edged lower. The US 10-year benchmark note dropped three-and-a-half basis points to 4.41%, while the 10-year yield on the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which correlates inversely to Gold prices, dropped three basis points to 2.081%.
Data from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showed that hedge funds boosted bullish bets on Gold futures to a three-week high in the week ending May 14.

Daily digest market movers: Gold price falls despite falling US yields following hawkish Fed comments

Gold price retreats amid falling US Treasury yields and a weaker US Dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback’s performance against a basket of six other currencies, is virtually unchanged at 104.64, putting a lid on XAU/USD prices.
Last week’s inflation data showed that underlying prices are easing. That reignited traders' expectations that the US central bank would resume easing policy. However, they must be cautious as Fed officials pushed back against just one reading that inflation is moderating.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that he is not in a hurry to reduce interest rates and prefers to keep them steady, emphasizing that the Fed's top priority is still addressing inflation.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller acknowledged that April’s CPI showed progress but mentioned that he needs to see several months of favorable inflation data before he can support a rate cut. Meanwhile, Michael Barr, the vice-chair of supervision, remarked, ""We still need to finish the job on inflation.""
On Monday, Vice-Chair Philip Jefferson said it’s too easy to tell when the disinflation process will resume while stating that the policy rate is restrictive. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester stated that inflation risks are tilted to the upside.
Data from the Chicago Board of Trade shows investors are expecting 35 basis points of Fed easing toward the end of the year.

Technical analysis: Gold price slides below $2,450 as bears target $2,400
Gold’s uptrend remains intact, but a daily close below the May 20 low of $2,407 could pave the way for a pullback. That event could form a ‘dark cloud cover,’ a two-candle chart pattern that implies the XAU/USD can print a leg down before extending its rally.
Momentum is on the back of buyers as depicted by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in bullish territory. However, the RSI is aiming lower, and once it clears the 50-midline, look for further declines.
On the upside, XAU/USD's first resistance would be the April 12 high of $2,431, followed by the all-time high of $2,450.
Conversely, if XAU/USD retreats below $2,400, that could expose the May 13 low at $2,332, followed by the May 8 low of $2,303. Once those levels are surpassed, the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,284 will be up next.

145,"May 21, 2024",No title found,"Gold price is correcting lower after touching an all-time high of $2,450 on Monday. 
The pullback appears to be driven by central banks communicating a reluctance to lower interest rates. 
Acute bearish divergence on the daily chart could indicate a deeper correction may follow. 

Gold price (XAU/USD) retreats to the $2,420s on Tuesday as commentary from central bank policymakers around the globe reveals a reluctance to commit to lowering interest rates. The precious metal tends to perform poorly in an environment of higher interest rates because of the returns investors can reap by remaining in cash or bonds. 
Persistent geopolitical concerns stemming from conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, however, are acting as a positive counterweight for Gold price. Gold hoarding by emerging markets and BRICS nations’ central banks as an insurance policy against Western sanctions – that usually target US Dollar (USD) or Euro (EUR) reserves – is a further supporting factor.  
Gold price retreats on shift in outlook for interest rates  
Gold price pulls back on Tuesday after central bankers in the US and Australia not only refuse to commit to lowering interest rates but also discuss the possibility of raising them. 
On Monday, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said the Fed could “even raise them (rates)” if inflation rose, and that it was “no longer appropriate” to expect the Fed to make three cuts this year. 
On Tuesday morning, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) released the minutes from its May meeting, which revealed that the board of governors had discussed the possibility of raising interest rates. It was the first time in many months they had discussed policy tightening. 
Technical Analysis: Gold price pulls back, RSI diverging
Gold price (XAU/USD) has pulled back from all-time highs at around $2,450 on Tuesday after forming a Shooting Star Japanese candlestick pattern on Monday. This candlestick pattern occurs when the price reaches a new high and then retreats to close near its low. It is a bearish sign after an uptrend, especially when followed by a red bearish candlestick on the next day, as is currently the case. If Tuesday ends as a red down day it could be a sign of a deeper correction to come.  
However, if Tuesday ends as a green bullish day, it will reduce the significance of the Shooting Star and could be a sign that the dominant bullish trend is more likely to continue. 
XAU/USD Daily Chart

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator shows acute bearish divergence with price on the daily chart, providing further evidence that a correction may be about to unfold. Although the Gold price rose above the April 12 peak to make a higher high on May 20, the RSI failed to make a higher high. This is a bearish indication, suggesting a greater chance of a pull-back evolving. 
If a correction unfolds, Gold will probably fall to support at the upward-sloping trendline in the $2,360s. 
However, the precious metal’s short-medium and long-term trends are bullish, and given the old adage that “the trend is your friend”, the odds favor an eventual recovery even if there is a correction. 
A break above the new $2,450 all-time high would likely continue the rally to the next target at the psychologically significant $2,500 level.

Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.

The hope for Fed rate cuts, rising geopolitical risks, and strong gold demand might cap the yellow metal’s downside.  
Investors await Fed’s Waller, Williams, Barr, Bostic, Collins, and Mester speeches later on Tuesday. 

For the latest news on Gold click here.
Gold price (XAU/USD) loses traction on Tuesday after reaching a record high earlier. The lack of fresh catalysts in a quiet session in terms of top-tier economic data might limit the precious metal’s upside. Nonetheless, the renewed demand by higher bets on interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve (Fed), ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the strong demand stemming from central banks and Asian buyers might provide some support to the yellow metal.

Gold traders will take more cues from the Fedspeak, with the Fed’s Waller, Williams, Barr, Bostic, Collins, and Mester scheduled to speak later on Tuesday. The FOMC Minutes will be the highlight on Wednesday. Furthermore, the hawkish stance from Fed officials is likely to lift the Greenback and drag the USD-denominated Gold lower. 
Daily Digest Market Movers: Gold price struggles to gain ground amid the USD recovery

Gold reached a record high on Monday at $2,450, and silver prices moved toward 12-year highs. Gold has risen 18% this year, while silver has gained 35%. 
Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr said that the central bank “will need to allow our restrictive policy some further time to continue to do its work.” 
Fed policymaker Philip Jefferson, another permanent voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, said inflation was still easing, although nowhere near as quickly as he expected. 
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that policy is restrictive and that it would take a while before the central bank gains confidence that inflation is headed to 2%. 
Investors see a 76% odd of rate cut from the Fed by 25 basis points (bps) in September and two cuts by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  

Technical Analysis: Gold price’s constructive outlook remains intact
Gold price posts edges lower on the day. According to the four-hour timeframe, the yellow metal keeps the positive stance unchanged as it holds above the key 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with an upward slope. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands in the bullish zone around 69.00, suggesting the support level is likely to hold rather than break. 

Any follow-through buying could make another attempt at breaking above an all-time high of $2,450. Further north, the next hurdle is seen at the $2,500 psychological mark.

On the other hand, the resistance-turned support level of $2,420 acts as an initial support level for XAU/USD. The additional downside filter to watch is the $2,400 round number. The key contention level will emerge at the 100-period EMA at $2,355.

Interest rates FAQs


 What are interest rates? 
Interest rates are charged by financial institutions on loans to borrowers and are paid as interest to savers and depositors. They are influenced by base lending rates, which are set by central banks in response to changes in the economy. Central banks normally have a mandate to ensure price stability, which in most cases means targeting a core inflation rate of around 2%. If inflation falls below target the central bank may cut base lending rates, with a view to stimulating lending and boosting the economy. If inflation rises substantially above 2% it normally results in the central bank raising base lending rates in an attempt to lower inflation.



 How do interest rates impact currencies? 
Higher interest rates generally help strengthen a country’s currency as they make it a more attractive place for global investors to park their money.



 How do interest rates influence the price of Gold? 
Higher interest rates overall weigh on the price of Gold because they increase the opportunity cost of holding Gold instead of investing in an interest-bearing asset or placing cash in the bank. If interest rates are high that usually pushes up the price of the US Dollar (USD), and since Gold is priced in Dollars, this has the effect of lowering the price of Gold.



 What is the Fed Funds rate? 
The Fed funds rate is the overnight rate at which US banks lend to each other. It is the oft-quoted headline rate set by the Federal Reserve at its FOMC meetings. It is set as a range, for example 4.75%-5.00%, though the upper limit (in that case 5.00%) is the quoted figure. Market expectations for future Fed funds rate are tracked by the CME FedWatch tool, which shapes how many financial markets behave in anticipation of future Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions.

Softer US inflation report boosts bets on Fed rate cuts with 76% odds for a September reduction.
Investors anticipate two rate cuts by year-end, potentially lowering the Federal funds rate to 4.75%-5.00%.

Gold price extended its gains on Monday, yet it trades slightly below the all-time high of $2,450 reached during the Asian session amid increasing expectations that major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, might ease policy during 2024. The XAU/USD trades at $2,433, up 0.80%.
Market sentiment is a mixed bag, though slightly positive, with the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 gaining, while the Dow Jones is almost flat. This and last week’s softer-than-expected consumer inflation report in the United States (US) boosted bets that the Fed could slash borrowing costs as soon as September, according to CME FedWatch Tool data.
Odds that the Fed would cut rates by 25 bps in September are at 76%. Investors have begun to price in two cuts toward the end of the year, which would leave the fed funds rate at 4.75%-5.00%.
In the meantime, Federal Reserve (Fed) speakers would dominate the US economic docket during the week before the latest Fed meeting minutes were released on Wednesday. On Thursday, US Initial Jobless Claims are expected to show the labor market is cooling, along with the Chicago Fed National Activity Index.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price trends higher despite hawkish Fed commentary

Gold price advances despite higher US Treasury yields and a weaker US Dollar. The US 10-year Treasury note yields 4.437% and is up one-and-a-half basis points (bps) from its opening level. DXY gains 0.06% to 104.55.
Last week’s inflation data showed that underlying prices are easing. That reignited traders' expectations that the US central bank would resume easing policy. However, they must be cautious as Fed officials pushed back against just one reading that inflation is moderating.
Earlier, Fed speakers grabbed the headlines. First, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that policy is restrictive and that it would take a while before they could be certain that inflation is headed to 2%. Vice-Chair Michel Barr echoed his words, noting the Fed will need to keep rates higher to “allow tight policy” to continue to do its work.
Recently, Vice-Chair Philip Jefferson said it’s too easy to tell when the disinflation process will resume while stating that the policy rate is restrictive.
As of writing, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester approved the latest CPI data and added that the risks of being “too restrictive” had gone down, while inflation risks are tilted to the upside.

Technical analysis: Gold price hits $2,450 as bulls target $2,500
Gold prices remain set to test higher prices after hitting a new all-time high of $2,450, which could open the door to further gains. Traders should know that momentum supports buyers as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to aim higher but is not yet at overbought readings.
If XAU/USD breaches the all-time high, the next stop would be $2,475, followed by the $2,500 mark.
Conversely, if XAU/USD retreats below $2,400, that could expose the May 13 low at $2,332, followed by the May 8 low of $2,303. Once those levels are surpassed, the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,284 will be up next.




Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

Metals grabbed all of the attention on Monday, as Gold and Copper traded at record highs at the beginning of the day, although shed some ground in a quiet European morning, as most local markets were closed due to the celebration of Whit Monday.
The American session provided little to work with, as the macroeconomic calendar only featured different Federal Reserve speakers, which anyway, repeated well-known messages and fell short of triggering action across the FX board.
The Greenback took clues from metals, recovering just modestly with Gold slide but resuming its slide ahead of Wall Street’s close as XAU/USD pressures the $2,430 price zone.
The EUR/USD pair held around 1.0860, while the GBP/USD stood at around 1.2700. Commodity-linked currencies were the most volatile, with AUD and CAD ending the day with losses vs the US Dollar.
Wall Street closed mixed, also failing to provide clues. The DJIA lost 200 points, although the S&P500 and the Nasdaq Composite managed to post uneven gains.
The upcoming Asian session will bring Australian Westpac Consumer Confidence and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meeting Minutes. There won’t be any relevant release throughout Tuesday.

150,"May 20, 2024",No title found,"Gold price rises on safe-haven demand after news of the President of Iran’s death increases tensions in the region.
Comments from Federal Reserve's Michael Barr, however, weigh on the precious metal.
Gold rises as a general fracturing of the world order drives central banks to stock up on the precious metal. 
A shift in expectations of when the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates further helps non-yielding Gold. 

Gold price (XAU/USD) pares its earlier gains to trade in the $2,410s on Monday after comments from Federal Reserve (Fed) Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr suggested interest rates would need to remain at their current level for longer to get inflation back to target sustainably. 

Barr was quoted as saying the ""Fed will need to allow tight policy further time to continue to do its work,"" during a speech on Monday. The US Dollar rose 0.1% after his words and Gold price fluctuated lower. 
Gold had risen to a new all-time high early on Monday due to its safe-haven qualities, as the geopolitical risk barometer rose a notch from increased tensions in the Middle East. 
Gold price rises on geopolitics, Fed expectations
Gold price rose to a new all-time high after the news that the President of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, as well as other high-profile political figures from Iran, died in a helicopter crash in the North of the country over the weekend, according to Reuters. This increased uncertainty in a region already simmering with tensions from the Israel-Hammas conflict. 
Russia’s opening up of a second front in the Kharkiv region and the bonding on display between Russian President Putin and Chinese President Xi during Putin’s recent visit to Beijing are further adding to a picture of a fracturing world order, with serious implications for world peace and free trade. All of which is supportive of Gold. 
Gold demand from BRICS countries and emerging economy central banks has increased substantially over recent years as a hedge against the threat of Western sanctions, according to the IMF. The trend is only likely to continue in light of recent events on the world stage. 
US Federal Reserve more likely to cut interest rates
Gold is also seeing demand as a result of a general lowering of expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will maintain interest rates at their current relatively high level for much longer. This is positive for Gold as it lowers the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset vis-a-vis cash or bonds. 
The change in outlook comes on the back of cooler inflation and retail sales data for April released last week. Although members of the Federal Reserve have been evasive about when the Fed might actually move to cut interest rates, the market sees a 65% chance that the fed fund rates will be lower than the current level in September, based on the CME FedWatch tool, which tracks the price of interest-rate futures. 
Technical Analysis: Gold price climbs parabolically 
Gold price (XAU/USD) rallies to new all-time highs above $2,440 on Monday, breaking out of the rising channel it has been in since May 2.  
The precious metal’s short-term trend is bullish, and more upside is expected given the old saying that “the trend is your friend.”  
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is overbought, however, indicating long-holders should not add to their positions. When the RSI falls back into the neutral zone (below 70), it will signal to close long-positions and that Gold price is undergoing a correction. Any such corrections are likely to find support at the upper channel line and former highs at $2,430. 
A break above the new $2,450 all-time high would likely continue the rally to the next target at the psychologically significant $2,500 level. 
The medium and long-term charts (daily and weekly) are also bullish, adding a supportive backdrop for Gold.



Risk sentiment FAQs


 What do the terms'risk-on' and 'risk-off' mean when referring to sentiment in financial markets? 
In the world of financial jargon the two widely used terms “risk-on” and “risk off'' refer to the level of risk that investors are willing to stomach during the period referenced. In a “risk-on” market, investors are optimistic about the future and more willing to buy risky assets. In a “risk-off” market investors start to ‘play it safe’ because they are worried about the future, and therefore buy less risky assets that are more certain of bringing a return, even if it is relatively modest.



 What are the key assets to track to understand risk sentiment dynamics? 
Typically, during periods of “risk-on”, stock markets will rise, most commodities – except Gold – will also gain in value, since they benefit from a positive growth outlook. The currencies of nations that are heavy commodity exporters strengthen because of increased demand, and Cryptocurrencies rise. In a “risk-off” market, Bonds go up – especially major government Bonds – Gold shines, and safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and US Dollar all benefit.



 Which currencies strengthen when sentiment is 'risk-on'? 
The Australian Dollar (AUD), the Canadian Dollar (CAD), the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) and minor FX like the Ruble (RUB) and the South African Rand (ZAR), all tend to rise in markets that are “risk-on”. This is because the economies of these currencies are heavily reliant on commodity exports for growth, and commodities tend to rise in price during risk-on periods. This is because investors foresee greater demand for raw materials in the future due to heightened economic activity.



 Which currencies strengthen when sentiment is 'risk-off'? 
The major currencies that tend to rise during periods of “risk-off” are the US Dollar (USD), the Japanese Yen (JPY) and the Swiss Franc (CHF). The US Dollar, because it is the world’s reserve currency, and because in times of crisis investors buy US government debt, which is seen as safe because the largest economy in the world is unlikely to default. The Yen, from increased demand for Japanese government bonds, because a high proportion are held by domestic investors who are unlikely to dump them – even in a crisis. The Swiss Franc, because strict Swiss banking laws offer investors enhanced capital protection.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) rose on Monday, according to FXStreet data. Silver trades at $31.97 per troy ounce, up 1.46% from the $31.51 it cost on Friday.
Silver prices have increased by 25.52% since the beginning of the year.

The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of troy ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one troy ounce of Gold, stood at 76.36 on Monday, down from 76.66 on Friday.
Investors might use this ratio to determine the relative valuation of Gold and Silver. Some may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued – or Gold is overvalued – and might buy Silver or sell Gold accordingly. Conversely, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

The hopes for Fed rate cuts and escalating Middle East tensions boost safe-haven assets like gold. 
Federal Reserve officials Bostic, Barr, Waller, Jefferson, and Mester are set to speak on Monday. 

The gold price (XAU/USD) gains momentum on Monday. The yellow metal hit a record high near $2,450 during the European session on Monday amid renewed hopes for interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Meanwhile, heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine also bolstered safe-haven demand, with both nations launching attacks against each other over the weekend.

Later on Monday, gold traders will focus on the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Bostic, Barr, Waller, Jefferson, and Mester speeches, which might offer some insight into the future path of monetary policy. The cautious approach or hawkish comments from Fed officials could limit the precious metal’s upside. 
Daily Digest Market Movers: Gold price edges higher amid geopolitical risks and uncertainties in the Middle East

Iranian state television is reporting that there is “no sign of life” at the crash site of the helicopter carrying Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi, according to Reuters.
Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin noted that inflation is easing but highlighted that it will ""take more time"" to reach the Fed’s 2% target.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said that the Fed's current monetary policy stance is appropriate as it continues to assess incoming economic data. 
Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said the policy is restrictive, but she is willing to hike rates if inflation stalls or reverses.
Financial markets have priced in 10% odds of a cut in June and a nearly 80% chance in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
The People's Bank of China (PBoC) added 60,000 troy ounces of gold to its stash in April, marking the 18th straight month of gold purchases, according to official data released Tuesday.

Technical Analysis: Gold price keeps the bullish vibe, focus on overbought RSI condition
Gold price trades with a positive bias on the day. The precious metal breaks above an ascending trend channel that has formed since May 2. Technically, the yellow metal maintains the bullish outlook unchanged on the four-hour chart as it is above the 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) holding above the midline around 82.50. Nonetheless, the overbought RSI condition indicates that further consolidation cannot be ruled out before positioning for any near-term gold upside. 

An all-time high of $2,440 acts as an immediate resistance level for XAU/USD. A decisive break above this level will see a rally to the potential upside barrier at the $2,500 psychological level. 

On the flip side, the resistance-turned support level at $2,415 will be the first downside target for the yellow metal. The crucial contention level is located at the $2,400 round number, followed by a low of May 16 at $2,370.

153,"May 20, 2024",No title found,"Gold price kicks off the new week on a positive note near $2,415. 
The softer US inflation data has prompted the Fed’s rate cut expectation, lifting the yellow metal.
The hawkish comments from Fed officials might cap the precious metal’s upside. 

Gold price (XAU/USD) gathers strength around $2,415 during the early Asian session on Monday. The softer US inflation data in April provides some support to the yellow metal. Meanwhile, the USD Index (DXY), the value of the US dollar measured against a group of six foreign currencies, edges lower to 104.50, losing 0.03% on the day.  Investors will take more cues from the Fed’s Bostic, Barr, Waller, Jefferson, and Mester on Monday.

The growing speculation that the US  Federal Reserve (Fed) could lower rates in 2024 provides some support to XAU/USD as the lower rate increases the attractiveness of non-yielding Gold to investors. Both US CPI inflations for April dropped to 0.3% MoM from a 0.4% rise in the previous reading. Both the headline and Core CPI printed lower but in line with market expectations. 

On the other hand, the cautious approach from the Fed might cap the upside of the precious metal, as higher interest rates might well reduce overall investment demand for non-yielding gold. Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that he thinks the US central bank will need more data to gain confidence on whether inflation is steadily falling towards 2%. Also, many Fed officials emphasised the need to hold the rate higher for longer, which boosts the Greenback broadly.

Lower April inflation in the US supports Gold’s rally, despite rising Treasury yields.
Fed officials remain cautious, with December 2024 rate cut expectations slightly adjusted to 35 bps.

Gold's price skyrocketed during the North American session ahead of the weekend as XAU/USD traded above $2,400, posting gains of more than 1.5% amid higher US Treasury bond yields. The non-yielding metal extended its advancement and threatened to crack the all-time high of $2,431.
A lower April inflationary reading in the United States (US) sponsored Gold’s leg up above the $2,400 mark, although US Treasury yields climbed. However, the Greenback is battered across the board and tumbled some 0.03%, according to the US Dollar Index (DXY), standing at 104.45.
That revived speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could lower rates in 2024. However, Fed officials stressed that one positive read for inflation is not enough with most regional Fed presidents maintaining a cautious stance.
According to the fed funds rate December 2024 futures contract, expectations that the Fed would lower rates dropped from 36 basis points (bps) to 35 bps toward the end of the year.

Gold prices advanced despite higher US Treasury yields and a weaker US Dollar. The US 10-year Treasury note yields 4.42% and is up four-and-a-half basis points (bps) from its opening level. DXY dropped 0.04% to 104.40.
On Wednesday, US inflation resumed its downtrend after stalling for six months, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The core Consumer Price Index (CPI) ebbed lower from 3.8% to 3.6% YoY in April, easing pressure on the Fed. This and soft Retail Sales augmented the odds for rate cut expectations by the Fed.
After the data, US equities rallied to new all-time highs, while the Greenback tumbled sharply, following the path of US Treasury yields.
Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin acknowledged that inflation is decreasing but emphasized that it will ""take more time"" to reach the Fed’s target.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester approved the latest CPI data, noting that the Fed's current monetary policy stance is appropriate as it continues to assess forthcoming economic data.
Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said the policy is restrictive but is willing to raise rates if inflation stalls or reverses.

Technical analysis: Gold price to extend its rally toward $2,500
Gold price’s bullish bias remains intact as the golden metal resumed its uptrend. Gold  buyers gather strength with the momentum on their side as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stays in bullish territory.
Therefore, the most likely scenario is that XAU/USD might test the all-time high of $2,431. Once cleared, the next stop would be the $2,450 mark, followed by the psychological $2,500 figure.
Conversely, if XAU/USD retreats below $2,400, that could expose the May 13 low at $2,332, followed by the May 8 low of $2,303. Once those levels are surpassed, the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,284 will be up next.




Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

155,"May 17, 2024",No title found,"Gold ticks higher on Friday after strong data from China, the largest market for Gold. 
Economists caution Chinese growth is “uneven”, however, and government stimulus is key. 
XAU/USD is in a short-term uptrend and may start climbing again after pulling back.  

Gold price (XAU/USD) is trading higher on Friday, in the $2,400s, helped by positive data from China that brightened the prospects for the country with the world’s largest market for Gold. 
In the US, meanwhile, a raft of secondary data released on Thursday came out mixed and Federal Reserve (Fed) officials repeated their mantra that inflation was still not coming down fast enough to contemplate cutting interest rates, with an overall neutralizing effect on Gold price. 
Gold had been rallying after cooler US inflation data and weak US Retail Sales released on Wednesday suggested the Fed might be closer to cutting interest rates than previously thought. The expectation of lower interest rates increases the attractiveness of non-yielding Gold to investors. 
Gold price rises after China data shows improvement 
Gold got a shot in the arm on Friday after Chinese Industrial Production showed an expectation-beating 6.7% rise year-over-year in April, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Economists had forecast a more modest 5.5%. The figure was substantially higher than the 4.5% reading registered in March. 
Chinese growth “uneven”
Despite the positive data, some economists remain skeptical about Chinese growth, describing it as “uneven”. 
“Activity data for April suggested growth remained uneven. Growth was supported by investment growth and exports, while consumption slowed,” said Tommy Wu, Senior Economist at Commerzbank. 
Fiscal spending key
Wu says greater fiscal spending is required to keep growth momentum steady and points out that the Chinese government is starting to sell sovereign bonds in order to boost spending. Much of the country’s growth expectations depend on whether the government sticks to its spending plans, he adds. 
The government is also working on comprehensive solutions to the housing crisis. A plan for local governments and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to buy unsold homes should help absorb inventory and prop up the ailing sector. Further, the PBoC has loosened restrictions on first-time buyers by lowering the minimum deposit to 15% from 25% and “scrapping the mortgage rate floor for first and second home buyers.”
Impact of US tariffs minor
As far as US tariffs on EVs and solar panels goes, Wu says the effect is likely to be minor given China only exports a small percentage of its EVs to the US and most Chinese solar panels are sold through intermediate countries without high tariffs. 
Technical Analysis: Gold price rising in channel
Gold price (XAU/USD) is trading back up at key resistance at $2,400. 
The precious metal has been rising in a channel since the May 2 lows, however, suggesting the short-term trend is bullish and more upside is eventually expected.  
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen back out of the overbought zone, suggesting renewed potential for more upside. 
The break above $2,400 now makes it more likely Gold will rally to the next resistance level at $2,417 (the April 19 high), followed by $2,430 – the all-time high. 
The medium and long-term charts (daily and weekly) are also bullish, adding a supportive backdrop for Gold.

156,"May 17, 2024",No title found,"Gold price edges higher despite the rebound of the USD on Friday. 
The softer US inflation data has triggered the expectation of Fed rate cuts, boosting the yellow metal.
Gold traders will focus on the Fed’s Kashkari, Waller, and Daly speeches on Friday. 

The gold price (XAU/USD) trades with a positive bias on Friday. The bullish move of precious metals in the previous sessions was bolstered by the softer-than-expected US inflation data in April, which triggered hope for rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve (Fed). However, the cautious approach from Fed officials on Thursday to keep borrowing costs high for longer suggested that the US central bank is not in a rush to cut interest rates this year. This, in turn, might boost the US Dollar (USD) broadly and drags the yellow metal lower, as higher interest rates might well reduce overall investment demand for non-yielding gold. 

In the absence of top-tier economic data from the US docket, market participants will monitor Fedspeak, which might offer some hints about the future path of the Fed’s monetary policy. The Fed’s Kashkari, Waller, and Daly are set to speak later on Friday. 
Daily Digest Market Movers: Gold price edges higher despite Fed officials suggest interest rates should stay higher for longer

The US weekly Initial Jobless Claims increased by 222K for the week ending May 11 from 232K in the previous week, above the 220K estimated, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 
Housing Starts rose by 5.7% MoM to 1.36 million in April, while Building Permits dropped by 3% MoM in April to 1.44 million.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he saw signs of cooling inflation in the recent CPI report, but he prefers to watch the May and June data to gain confidence that the inflation doesn’t turn back the other way.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said policy was well positioned, and it was too soon to say progress on inflation had stalled. 
Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin noted the central bank needs to keep borrowing costs high for longer to ensure inflation is on track to its target, citing higher prices in the services sector.
Financial markets are currently pricing in nearly 75% odds of a Fed rate cut in September, an increase from 65% earlier in the week. The markets are also pricing in full 25 basis point (bps) rate cuts before the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. 

Technical Analysis: Gold price’s upside remains intact
The gold price trades on a positive note on the day. According to the four-hour chart, the precious metal has formed an ascending trend channel since May 2. The constructive outlook of gold remains intact, as it is above the 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The path of the least resistance is to the upside, as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands in the bullish territory around 72.00. 

The upper boundary of the ascending trend channel and psychological barrier of $2,400 act as a crucial resistance level for the yellow metal for the time being. With a break above this level, gold could make another attempt at an all-time high of $2,432 en route to the $2,500 round figure. 
In the bearish case, the first downside filter to watch is the lower limit of the ascending trend channel of $2,355. Further south, the next contention level is seen at the 100-period EMA at $2,340. Any follow-through selling below the mentioned level might drag XAU/USD back to $2,300. 



(This story was corrected on May 17 at 07:29 GMT to say, in the technical analysis section, that the RSI stands around 72.00, not 62.00.)

Daily digest market movers: Gold shines amid dropping US yields as rate cut expectations rise

Gold prices are undermined by lower US Treasury yields and a battered US Dollar. The US 10-year Treasury note yields 4.373% and is up 3 basis points (bps) from its opening level. DXY climbs 0.19% to 104.47.

Technical analysis: Gold pulls back from weekly highs as buyers take a respite
Gold’s uptrend remains unchanged despite retreating below the $2,380 area, with strong momentum on the side of buyers as depicted by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. From a market structure standpoint, if XAU/USD drops below the latest higher low seen on May 13 at $2,332, that could open the door for a deeper correction.
In that scenario, the next line of defense for buyers would be the May 8 low of $2,303, followed by the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,284.
Conversely, if buyers reclaim the $2,400 level, further gains are seen, putting at risk the year-to-date high. A breach of the latter, the immediate supply zone would be the April 19 high at $2,417, followed by the all-time high at $2,431.

158,"May 16, 2024",No title found,"Gold price corrects after rallying after the release of US data that changed the outlook for interest rates, a key factor for Gold. 
The data revealed cooling inflation and flatlining spending, which suggests interest rates might fall. 
Lower interest rates are positive for Gold price and the pair is in an uptrend on the charts.

Gold price (XAU/USD) trades lower in the $2,370s on Thursday after making significant gains on the previous day. Gold bulls flexed their muscles following the release of US inflation data that led to a recalibration of interest rate expectations, with implications for both the US Dollar (USD) and Gold price. 
Gold stabilizes following rally after release of US data 
Gold price is correcting back on Thursday amid profit taking after an over one percent rise on the previous day. The release of cooler US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and Retail Sales for April led to a change in expectations for the future path of US interest rates, a key factor in Gold valuations. 
The lower-than-expected CPI data reflected a disinflationary trend that brought forward the time when the Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to make its long-awaited cut in interest rates. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there is around 75% probability that the fed funds rate will be at lower levels after the September meeting. This is much higher than the 65% chance seen before the CPI release, according to FXStreet Editor Lallalit Srijandorn. 
The expectation of lower interest rates is positive for Gold as it reduces the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset vis-a-vis cash or bonds. Gold is further lifted by the loss of value of the US Dollar (USD) that attended the data, as like most commodities Gold is chiefly traded in US Dollars. 
Still, the outlook for the precious metal remains positive against a backdrop of continued robust demand from central banks – in particular those in emerging markets – high levels of geopolitical risk and concerns regarding a fracturing of world trade along partisan lines.
Indeed, according to data from the World Gold Council (WGC), demand for Gold “rose by 3% to 1,238 tonnes, making it the strongest first quarter since 2016,” writes Srijandorn.   
Technical Analysis: Gold price pulls back after strong rise
Gold price (XAU/USD) has pushed up to just shy of resistance at $2,400 as it extends its short-term uptrend higher.
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, cautioning traders not to add to their long positions as there is an increased chance of a pullback. If the RSI exits overbought it will signal a deeper correction is underway.
That said, the precious metal remains in an uptrend and, given the old saying “the trend is your friend,” Gold price is likely to continue trading with a bullish bias. A break above $2,400 would likely see it rally to the next resistance level at $2,417 (the April 19 high), followed by $2,430 – the all-time high. 
The medium and long-term charts (daily and weekly) are also bullish, adding a supportive backdrop for Gold. 


Economic Indicator


Consumer Price Index (MoM)
Inflationary or deflationary tendencies are measured by periodically summing the prices of a basket of representative goods and services and presenting the data as The Consumer Price Index (CPI). CPI data is compiled on a monthly basis and released by the US Department of Labor Statistics. The MoM figure compares the prices of goods in the reference month to the previous month.The CPI is a key indicator to measure inflation and changes in purchasing trends. Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is seen as bearish.

Why it matters to traders?
The US Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of maintaining price stability and maximum employment. According to such mandate, inflation should be at around 2% YoY and has become the weakest pillar of the central bank’s directive ever since the world suffered a pandemic, which extends to these days. Price pressures keep rising amid supply-chain issues and bottlenecks, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) hanging at multi-decade highs. The Fed has already taken measures to tame inflation and is expected to maintain an aggressive stance in the foreseeable future.

Daily Digest Market Movers: Gold price edges higher due to cooling US inflation, weaker Retail Sales

The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 3.4% YoY in April, compared to a rise of 3.5% in March, which is in line with market expectations. On a monthly basis, the headline CPI inflation dropped to 0.3% MoM in April from 0.4% in March, below the consensus of 0.4%. 
The core CPI inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, rose by 3.6% YoY in April, compared to the previous reading of 3.8%. The monthly core CPI eased to 0.3% MoM in April from 0.4% in March. 
US Retail Sales came in at 0% MoM in April from a 0.6% rise in March, worse than the estimation of 0.4%.  
Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said on Wednesday that the central bank needs to watch the economy carefully to see if current policy rates are restrictive enough.
Financial markets are currently pricing in a nearly 75% chance of a rate cut by the Fed in September 2024, a rise from 65% before the US CPI report, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool.
According to the World Gold Council's Q1 2024 report, global gold demand climbed by 3% to 1,238 tonnes, marking the strongest first quarter since 2016. 

Technical Analysis: Gold price’s bullish outlook holds strong 
The gold price edges higher on the day. Technically, the yellow metal has formed an ascending trend channel since May 2. The yellow metal maintains its positive stance unchanged on the four-hour chart as XAU/USD holds above the 100-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands in bullish territory around 72. The overbought RSI condition indicates that further consolidation cannot be ruled out before positioning for any near-term XAU/USD upside. 

The first upside barrier will emerge near the upper boundary of the ascending trend channel and psychological level of $2,400. A bullish breakout above this level will expose $2,432 (all-time high) en route to $2,500 (round figure). 

On the downside, a breach of the lower limit of the ascending trend channel of $2,345 will pave the way to $2,334 (100-period EMA), followed by $2,300 (psychological mark).

Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

160,"May 15, 2024",No title found,"Gold price hits $2,390, its highest level in three weeks, gaining over 1%.
US Treasury bond yields plunge, US Dollar Index drops to five-week low.
April Retail Sales stagnate, while Fed officials express concerns about restrictive monetary policy.

Gold price extended its uptrend for the second straight day on Wednesday and hit a three-week high of $2,390 after data revealed by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed inflation is ebbing, increasing the odds for a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in 2024. Hence, US Treasury bond yields are plunging, while the Greenback tumbles to a five-week low as depicted by the US Dollar Index (DXY).
The XAU/USD trades at $2,384 and gains more than 1%. Despite standing above 3% on an annual basis, consumer inflation slowed in monthly figures, easing pressure on the Fed. US Treasury yields along the short and long ends of the curve are diving between 8 and 10 basis points.
Other data announced by the US BLS witnessed a deterioration in consumer spending, as Retail Sales in April remained unchanged at 0% MoM, below estimates of a 0.4% increase.
Elsewhere, Fed officials continued to make headlines. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said that with higher government debt, it might take higher borrowing costs in the near term to achieve 2% inflation. He said he’s surprised by consumers' spending and added that the big question is “how restrictive monetary policy is.”
Daily digest market movers: Gold shines amid dropping US yields as rate cut expectations rise

Gold prices are underpinned by lower US Treasury yields and a battered US Dollar. The US 10-year Treasury note yields 4.352% and is down 9 basis points (bps) from its opening level. DXY falls 0.66% to 104.33.
On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented that he expects inflation to continue heading lower but wasn’t as confident about the disinflation outlook as he had previously been.
BLS reveals that April’s Consumer Price Index rose by 0.3% MoM, below estimates and March’s 0.4%. Core CPI rose by 0.3% MoM as expected but beneath the prior reading of 0.4%.
Other data showed that Retail Sales missed estimates of 0.4% and came at 0% MoM, below March’s 0.6%. In the twelve months to April, Retail Sales grew by 3%, below the 3.8% increase of the previous reading.
Further data will be featured during the week, led by Initial Jobless Claims and Industrial Production on May 16.
The New York Federal Reserve released its monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations on Monday, showing that the year's inflation expectations increased to 3.3% vs. 3% in March. The data came after the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment poll showed that inflation expectations for a one-year outlook rose from 3.2% to 3.5%.
Interest rate cut expectations toward the end of the year edged up from 35 basis points on Tuesday to 42 bps, according to data provided by the Chicago Board of Trade.

Technical analysis: Gold price clears May 10 high, on its way towards $2,400

Gold price’s rally was prolonged for the second straight day, yet it was shy of challenging the $2,400 figure. Once buyers surpassed $2,378, the May 10 high paved the way for a new trading range within the $2,380 to $2,400 range.
Momentum favors buyers as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains bullish with readings above 60. Therefore, the path of least resistance is upward.
That said, the XAU/USD first resistance would be $2,400. Once surpassed, the immediate supply zone would be the April 19 high at $2,417, followed by the all-time high at $2,431.
Conversely, if sellers moved in and pushed prices below $2,359, that could sponsor a leg down toward the May 9 low of $2,306, followed by the $2,300 figure. Once surpassed, the next stop would be the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,249.

161,"May 15, 2024",No title found,"Gold rises above the May highs after the release of lower-than-expected US CPI and Retail Sales data.
The data hurt USD and indicates the possibility interest rates might fall more quickly than expected, aiding Gold.
Robust central-bank demand is a key factor in keeping the precious metal bid. 
After a deep correction, XAU/USD resumes its uptrending bias and pushes higher. 

Gold price (XAU/USD) trades higher on Wednesday after the release of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Sales data for April came out lower than economists had expected. The data means the Federal Reserve (Fed) might cut interest rates sooner than had previously been thought. Lower interest rates or their expectation are positive for Gold because it reduces the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset. 
Gold rises after release of US data
US headline CPI rose 0.3% in April which was below expectations of 0.4% and March's 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis CPI met expectations of a 3.4% rise, which was below the 3.5% YoY of the previous month of March, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

US CPI ex Food and Energy came out in line with expectations, rising 0.3% MoM in April and 3.6% YoY, but this was still lower than the 0.4% and 3.8% of the prior month respectively. 
US Retail Sales in April, meanwhile, came out well below expectations, registering 0.0% growth in April when 0.4% had been estimated, down from 0.6% in March, according to data from the US Census Bureau released at the same time. The fall in retail sales sounded another note of caution regarding the US economy that could further encourage Fed officials to consider cutting interest rates. 

The combination of disinflation reflected in the CPI data and flatlining Retail Sales may prompt the Fed to consider cutting interest rates in the near term, a move that would weigh on the US Dollar (USD) but be bullish for Gold. 
Gold price creeps higher on the back of sustained demand 
Gold price also remains bid on the back of continued safe-haven demand due to geopolitical and global trade tensions. 
In a speech at Stanford last week, Gita Gopinath, the First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said that central banks, particularly in emerging markets, have been hoarding Gold in recent years as a hedge against the risk of, among other things, sanctions imposed by the West. 
“Gold purchases by some central banks may have been driven by concerns about sanctions risk. This is consistent with a recent IMF study confirming that FX reserve managers tend to increase Gold holdings to hedge against economic uncertainty and geopolitical including sanctions risk,” said Gopinath. 
The view is also backed up by data from the World Gold Council (WGC) showing strong demand in 2024 from central banks. 
Given the heightened tensions in the Middle East, Ukraine and the increasingly polarized stand-off between the BRICS nations and US-led allies, the trend is expected to sustain, keeping Gold prices supported.
Technical Analysis: Gold price recovers after backslide
Gold price (XAU/USD) has recovered back up to almost the level of the May highs at $2,379, after finding support and resuming its short-term uptrend.
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

Given the old saying “the trend is your friend”, Gold is likely to continue pushing higher, with the next target at around $2,400, roughly at the April highs. A break back above the $2,378 May 10 high would provide extra confirmation. 
The medium and long-term charts (daily and weekly) are also bullish, adding a supportive backdrop for Gold.


Economic Indicator


Consumer Price Index (MoM)
Inflationary or deflationary tendencies are measured by periodically summing the prices of a basket of representative goods and services and presenting the data as The Consumer Price Index (CPI). CPI data is compiled on a monthly basis and released by the US Department of Labor Statistics. The MoM figure compares the prices of goods in the reference month to the previous month.The CPI is a key indicator to measure inflation and changes in purchasing trends. Generally, a high reading is seen as bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is seen as bearish.

Why it matters to traders?
The US Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of maintaining price stability and maximum employment. According to such mandate, inflation should be at around 2% YoY and has become the weakest pillar of the central bank’s directive ever since the world suffered a pandemic, which extends to these days. Price pressures keep rising amid supply-chain issues and bottlenecks, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) hanging at multi-decade highs. The Fed has already taken measures to tame inflation and is expected to maintain an aggressive stance in the foreseeable future.

The growth in gold demand and geopolitical tensions lift the price of precious metals.
The US CPI and Retail Sales data on Wednesday could offer some hints about the Fed’s monetary policy path.

The gold price (XAU/USD) trades with mild positive bias on the weaker US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday. The rising gold demand from robust over-the-counter (OTC) market investments, consistent central bank purchases, and safe-haven flows amid Middle East geopolitical risk act as a tailwind for XAU/USD. Nonetheless, the Federal Reserve (Fed) officials' hawkish remarks, including Chairman Jerome Powell's suggestion to keep interest rates higher for longer, might drag the yellow metal lower in the near term.

Later on Wednesday, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April will be released, and it could offer insights into the timing of the Fed's initial rate adjustment. Also, the Retail Sales for April will be published, and insight into consumer spending trends will be provided. The hotter-than-estimated inflation data could lead the Fed to a more aggressive stance, which boosts the Greenback and exerts some selling pressure on USD-denominated gold. 
Daily Digest Market Movers: Gold price gains momentum amid gold investment demand

The US Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 2.2% YoY in April, compared to the 1.8% increase in March and matching expectations. The Core PPI jumped 2.4% YoY in the same period, compared to an increase of 2.1% in March. On a monthly basis, the PPI and the core PPI both rose 0.5% MoM in April. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that inflation is falling slower than expected, and the PPI data provided more justification to keep rates higher for longer. Powell added that more rate hikes likely won't be needed.
Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid noted that inflation remains too high, and the US central bank has more work to do.
The annual headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is expected to ease to 3.4% in April from 3.5% in the first estimates. The Core CPI inflation is estimated to drop to 3.6% in April from 3.8% prior. 
The US Retail Sales is projected to decline to 0.4% MoM in April from 0.7% in the preliminary reading. 
Financial markets are currently pricing in nearly 65% odds of a rate cut by the Fed in September 2024, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool.
Global gold demand rose by 3% to 1,238 tonnes, making it the strongest first quarter since 2016, according to the World Gold Council's Q1 2024 report. 

Technical Analysis: Gold price holds a constructive picture
The gold price trades on a positive note on the day. According to the four-hour chart, the yellow metal maintains its positive stance unchanged as XAU/USD holds above the key 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands in the bullish zone at 60.70, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. 

Any follow-through buying above a high of May 10 at $2,378 could clear the path for a rally to the next major resistance near the $2,400 psychological barrier. A decisive upside break above the mentioned level will expose an all-time high near $2,432 en route to the $2,500 round figure.

On the flip side, the key support level for gold will emerge at the $2,325–$2,330 region, representing the confluence of the lower limit of the descending trend channel, the 100-period EMA, and a low of May 13. The breach of this level will see a drop to the $2,300 round figure, followed by a low of May 2 at $2,281.

Despite a spike, Treasury yields reversed to 4.445%, weakening Greenback and boosting Gold.
Powell's waning confidence in disinflation and optimistic GDP outlook of 2% or more fuel Gold's rise.

Gold prices climbed past the $2,359 figure on Tuesday after data released by the US Department of Labor revealed that factory gate inflation rose above estimates, signaling that prices remained elevated. Despite that, US Treasury yields are sliding, a headwind for the Greenback.
Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell made headlines after the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI). He commented that he expects inflation to continue heading lower but wasn’t as confident about the disinflation outlook as he had previously been. He added that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to grow by 2% or better due to the labor market's strength.
The XAU/USD trades at $2,359, up 0.97%. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that prices paid by producers increased above estimates, with just one reading aligning with economists’ consensus. US Treasury yields jumped sharply toward a daily high of 4.534%, before reversing later.
Daily digest market movers: Gold bright amid falling US yields, soft US Dollar

Gold prices fell amid lower US Treasury yields and a strong US Dollar. The US 10-year Treasury note yields 4.451% and is down nearly 4 basis points (bps) from its opening level. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's performance against six other currencies, falls 0.20% to 105.00.
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the Producer Price Index (PPI) increased by 0.5% MoM, surpassing the forecasted 0.3% rise. Similarly, the core PPI, which excludes food and energy prices, also rose by 0.5%, beating the expected 0.2% increase. Both figures were significantly higher than March's decline of 0.1% in both general and underlying inflation, indicating a jump in producer prices.
April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) is projected to remain unchanged compared to March’s reading at 0.4% MoM. The core CPI is expected to resume its lower trend from 0.4% in March to 0.3% MoM.
Further data will be featured during the week, led by Retail Sales on May 15, Initial Jobless Claims, and Industrial Production on May 16.
The New York Federal Reserve released its monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations on Monday, showing that the year's inflation expectations increased to 3.3% vs. 3% in March. The data came after the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment poll showed that inflation expectations for a one-year outlook rose from 3.2% to 3.5%.
Interest rate cut expectations toward the end of the year remain at 35 basis points (bps), according to data provided by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).

Technical analysis: Gold price surge above $2,350 with bulls eyeing $2,400

Gold’s uptrend extended after posting losses on Monday, yet it remains below the latest cycle high of $2,378, seen on May 10. This could keep the XAU/USD range bound. According to readings of the Relative Strength Index (RSI), momentum is in favor of the bulls.
Therefore, the XAU/USD first resistance would be the May 10 high at $2,378. If broken, the next technical hurdle would be the psychological $2,400 mark, immediately followed by the April 19 high at $2,417, and the all-time high at $2,431.
Conversely, if sellers moved in and pushed prices below $2,359, that could sponsor a leg down toward the May 9 low of $2,306, followed by the $2,300 figure. Once surpassed, the next stop would be the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,249.

Demand from investors including central banks due to Gold’s safe-haven qualities remains high. 
XAU/USD finds support and remains in a short-term uptrend, indicating it could recover.   

Gold price (XAU/USD) stabilizes in the $2,330s on Tuesday as geopolitical risks continue to stoke demand for the safe-haven asset. 
Gains may be capped, however, after data out of the US indicated interest rates will probably remain elevated for some time yet, reducing the attractiveness of the non-yielding precious metal. 
Gold price finds a floor on geopolitical risks
Gold price finds a floor on Tuesday as rising geopolitical risks prime demand for the safe-haven asset. 
Increasing protests against Israel’s occupation of Gaza, Russia’s opening up of a new front in Ukraine, as well as fears of a fragmentation in global trade have lifted the “threat-level” of geopolitical risk up a notch. 
IMF warns that global trade is at risk
In a speech to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research on Monday, Gita Gopinath, the First Deputy Managing Director of the IMF warned: “Countries are reevaluating their trading partners based on economic and national security concerns,” adding that if the trend continued, “we could see a broad retreat from global rules of engagement and, with it, a significant reversal of the gains from economic integration.”
Western and US sanctions against Russia, Iran and other emerging market nations are a factor in the “fragmentation” of trade alliances along geopolitical lines. The response by investors and central banks is to horde Gold. 
Golden alternative to the US Dollar
The move by BRICs nations away from the use of the US Dollar as the medium of international trade has increased demand for Gold as a possible replacement. 
This has been the main reason for the surge in non-Western central bank demand for Gold and a corresponding reduction in US Dollar reserves. 
Gold is seen as a possible replacement for the US Dollar as a safe store of value in international trade deals between nations with volatile domestic currencies, according to Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an advisory service based in Washington. 
Gold capped by US data 
Gold price upside may be capped, however, following survey data from the Reserve Bank of New York which showed US consumers still expect shop prices to rise over the next year. The data indicates the Federal Reserve (Fed) might have to keep interest rates elevated for longer to wrestle inflation down. 
NY Consumer Sentiment in April, released on Monday, showed one-year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 3.3%, from 3.0% in March, the level it had been at since November 2023. The reading is well above the 2.0% target of the Federal Reserve and makes it likely the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer.
Since Gold is a non-interest-bearing asset it’s a less attractive option when real interest rates are high. 
Real interest rates – or interest investors can get minus inflation – remain relatively high according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, increasing the opportunity-cost of holding non-yielding assets such as Gold.

Technical Analysis: Gold price finds support after backslide
Gold price (XAU/USD) has found a floor after backsliding over recent sessions. 
Gold broke below major support from previous highs at around $2,350 but has since found support just above another set of highs at around $2,330. 
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

Despite the steep correction, the precious metal remains in a bullish short-term trend, which given the old saying “the trend is your friend”, is likely to resume and push prices higher again. There are no signs yet the uptrend is resuming, although bearish momentum on the pullback has petered out for now.
Assuming the uptrend does resume, the next target for Gold would be at around $2,400, roughly at the April highs. A breakback above the $2,378 May 10 high would provide confirmation. 
The medium and long-term charts (daily and weekly) are also bullish, adding a supportive backdrop for Gold. 



Interest rates FAQs


 What are interest rates? 
Interest rates are charged by financial institutions on loans to borrowers and are paid as interest to savers and depositors. They are influenced by base lending rates, which are set by central banks in response to changes in the economy. Central banks normally have a mandate to ensure price stability, which in most cases means targeting a core inflation rate of around 2%. If inflation falls below target the central bank may cut base lending rates, with a view to stimulating lending and boosting the economy. If inflation rises substantially above 2% it normally results in the central bank raising base lending rates in an attempt to lower inflation.



 How do interest rates impact currencies? 
Higher interest rates generally help strengthen a country’s currency as they make it a more attractive place for global investors to park their money.



 How do interest rates influence the price of Gold? 
Higher interest rates overall weigh on the price of Gold because they increase the opportunity cost of holding Gold instead of investing in an interest-bearing asset or placing cash in the bank. If interest rates are high that usually pushes up the price of the US Dollar (USD), and since Gold is priced in Dollars, this has the effect of lowering the price of Gold.



 What is the Fed Funds rate? 
The Fed funds rate is the overnight rate at which US banks lend to each other. It is the oft-quoted headline rate set by the Federal Reserve at its FOMC meetings. It is set as a range, for example 4.75%-5.00%, though the upper limit (in that case 5.00%) is the quoted figure. Market expectations for future Fed funds rate are tracked by the CME FedWatch tool, which shapes how many financial markets behave in anticipation of future Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions.

Any signs of sticky inflation might further diminish expectations of US interest rate cuts this year, pressuring yellow metal. 
The US PPI report for April and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech will be in the spotlight on Tuesday. 

The gold price (XAU/USD) rebounds despite the consolidation of the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday. The upside of yellow metal might be limited as traders might wait on the sidelines ahead of key US inflation data this week. The higher-for-longer US rate mantra has exerted some selling pressure on the XAU/USD in recent sessions. However, the safe-haven flows due to escalating Middle East tensions might boost the gold price for the time being.
Investors will closely watch the key US economic data this week. The US Producer Price Index (PPI) for April is due on Tuesday, along with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech. The attention will shift to the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), due on Wednesday. These reports could offer insights into the timing of the Fed's initial rate adjustment. The hotter-than-expected inflation figures might dampen the prospect of a Fed rate cut, weighing on the precious metal. Higher interest rates may reduce overall investment demand for gold as they increase the opportunity cost associated with holding gold.

Daily Digest Market Movers: Gold price holds positive ground, all eyes are on the crucial  US inflation data

Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson called for holding interest rates at current levels until inflation shows more signs of easing, adding that he will continue to look for additional evidence that inflation is going to return to the 2% target. 
The Fed is likely to cut the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) in September, said 70 of 108 economists, while cutting rates by 50 bps in 2024, said 65 of 108 economists, according to the Reuters poll. 
On Monday, Israeli soldiers moved deep into the ruins of Gaza's northern frontier to retake an area from Hamas rebels, while tanks and troops pushed a highway into Rafah, forcing Palestinian residents to flee, per Reuters. 
The US Producer Price Index (PPI) for April is expected to show an increase of 2.2% YoY, while the Core PPI figure is estimated to show an increase of 2.4% YoY in the same period. 
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is forecast to ease to 3.4% YoY in April from 3.5% prior. Core CPI inflation is projected to drop to 3.6% YoY in April from 3.8% in March. 

Technical Analysis: Gold price maintains a positive outlook
The gold price edges higher on the day. The yellow metal keeps the bullish vibe unchanged as XAU/USD remains above the key 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour chart. The upward momentum is reinforced by the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is in the bullish zone at 52.70, indicating the support level is likely to hold rather than break. 

A high of May 10 at $2,378 acts as an immediate resistance level for the precious metal. Extended gains will pave the way to the $2,400 psychological level. A break above this level will see a rally to an all-time high near $2,432, en route to the $2,500 round figure. 

On the other hand, the crucial support level will emerge around the $2,325–$2,340 zone, portraying the confluence of the resistance-turned-support level and the 100-period EMA. The breach of this level will expose a low of May 2 at $2,281.

Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

166,"May 13, 2024",No title found,"Gold falls 1%, retreating from $2,350, despite typically supportive lower US Treasury yields.
US economic events, including inflation data and a speech by Fed Chair Powell, are poised to influence markets.
Fed Vice-Chairman Jefferson was hawkish, stressed importance of driving inflation toward 2% target.

Gold prices retreated sharply on Monday from near $2,350 even though US Treasury yields declined, undermining appetite for the Greenback. Traders brace for a busy economic docket in the United States (US) led by the release of inflation figures, Retail Sales, and the May 14 speech of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell.
Earlier on Monday, Fed Vice-Chairman Philip Jefferson addressed the media in a Q&A session at the Cleveland Fed. He said, “We continue to look for additional evidence that inflation is going to return to our 2% target.”
The XAU/USD trades at $2,336, down 1% amid a risk-on impulse. Wall Street continues to post gains. Recent labor market data, such as April’s Nonfarm Payrolls and last week’s Initial Unemployment Claims, could pressure the Fed. In its latest monetary policy statement, officials recognized that the risks to achieving the Fed's dual mandate of fostering maximum employment and price stability have become more balanced over the past year.
Meanwhile, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is expected to release the producer and consumer inflation data for April on May 14 and 15. If price pressures reaccelerate, the Fed can hold rates “higher for longer.”
Daily digest market movers: Gold falls as US data could influence Fed’s rate path

Gold prices fell amid lower US Treasury yields and a strong US Dollar. The US 10-year Treasury note yields 4.479% and is down two basis points (bps) from its opening level. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's performance against six other currencies, falls 0.10% to 105.20.
The Producer Price Index (PPI) for April is expected to be at 0.3% MoM, a tenth above the prior month’s number. Core PPI is foreseen at 0.2% MoM, unchanged compared to March.
April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) is projected to remain unchanged compared to March’s reading at 0.4% MoM. The Core CPI is expected to resume its lower trend from 0.4% in March to 0.3% MoM.
Investors are eyeing Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on May 14.
Further data will be featured during the week, led by Retail Sales on May 15, Initial Jobless Claims, and Industrial Production on May 16.
The New York Federal Reserve released its monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations on Monday, showing that the year's inflation expectations increased to 3.3% vs. 3% in March. The data came after the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment poll showed that inflation expectations for a one-year outlook rose from 3.2% to 3.5%.
Interest rate cut expectations toward the end of the year remain at 34 basis points (bps), according to data provided by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).

Technical analysis: Gold price tumbles below $2,350 with bears eyeing $2,300
The uptrend in the Gold price remains intact, even though from a technical perspective the formation of a quasi Shooting Star candlestick pattern followed by a bearish Belt Hold line opened the door for a leg down. Although momentum favors buyers, the short term is aiming lower, meaning they’re losing traction.
Hence, XAU/USD's first support would be the May 9 low of $2,306, followed by the $2,300 figure. Once cleared, the next stop would be the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2,249.
On the other hand, if buyers reclaim $2,359, look for a test of the April 26 high at $2,352. A breach of the latter would expose the $2,400 figure, immediately followed by the April 19 high at $2,417 and the all-time high of $2,431.

167,"May 13, 2024",No title found,"Gold falls after US Consumer Sentiment data shows a sharp decline in optimism and higher inflation expectations. 
Higher inflation could keep interest rates elevated, reducing the attractiveness of non-yielding Gold. 
Uptrending XAU/USD corrects back and puts pressure on a key support level. 

Gold price (XAU/USD) corrects back, falling a half a percent to the $2,340s on Monday after US Consumer Sentiment data suggested interest rates may remain higher for longer, reducing Gold’s attractiveness as a non-yielding asset. 
Gold price falls after Michigan Sentiment Survey data
Gold price has reversed lower following the release of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey on Friday, which showed a surprise fall in sentiment whilst at the same time higher inflation expectations. 
The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for May fell to 67.4 from 77.2 when economists had expected a much gentler decline to 76.0. 
At the same time, the long-run inflation expectations component rose to 3.1% from 3.0% previously. 
Higher inflation expectations suggest the Federal Reserve (Fed) may continue to delay its expected move to cut interest rates. This is negative for Gold since higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding Gold compared to interest-yielding assets like bonds or cash. 
Technical Analysis: Gold price corrects sharply back
Gold price (XAU/USD) is correcting back after its rally at the start of May. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator moved into neutral territory during the US session on Friday after being overbought, giving a sell signal, and price responded accordingly. 
Gold has reached a major support level from previous highs at $2,350, which it is attempting to pierce through. If it is successful it could continue to fall. 
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

Despite the pull back the short-term trend is still probably bullish, suggesting it is likely the precious metal will stop correcting at some point and resume its uptrend. There are no signs yet of this happening however. 
Assuming the uptrend does resume, the next target for Gold would be at around $2,400, roughly at the height of the April highs. A break back above the $2,378 May 10 high would provide confirmation. 
The medium and long-term charts (daily and weekly) are also bullish, adding a supportive backdrop for Gold.
