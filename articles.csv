0,"Jun 21, 2024",Are advanced economy central banks giving up on the U.S. dollar?,"(Kitco News) - There is growing frustration in the gold market as the precious metal continues to churn in a narrow range between $2,300 and $2,350. However, this consolidation is also removing froth from the market and helping us focus on the broader landscape.Since March, the gold market has been on an impressive run, rallying to a new all-time high above $2,450 an ounce. Although momentum has stalled, it is important to recognize that the factors behind the rally have not disappeared.The world remains rife with geopolitical uncertainty, especially ahead of the November U.S. elections. The U.S. dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency continues to be challenged, and the global inflation threat persists.According to the World Gold Council’s annual Central Bank Gold Reserves survey, these are the top reasons why both retail investors and central banks are buying gold.This year, 70 central banks were surveyed, and 29% expect to increase their exposure to gold in the next 12 months. At the same time, 81% of central banks expect global central bank gold reserves to increase over the next year.This is the strongest response the WGC has received from its gold survey, which started in 2018. While these are impressive stats, what really jumped out at me was the long-term outlook central banks see for their gold reserves and the U.S. dollar, even among developed economies.According to the survey, 57% of advanced-economy central banks see gold’s share of global reserves rising in the next five years, up from 38% in 2023.Meanwhile, 23% of developing market central banks see the U.S. dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency diminishing over the next five years, up from 13% reported last year.I would expect emerging markets to shift their focus away from the U.S. dollar as they diversify their reserve assets.Then again, this might not be such a big surprise if we look at the trajectory of U.S. government debt. This week, the Congressional Budget Office released new projections that show federal government debt to be $1.9 trillion, or 6.7% of GDP, for the 2024 fiscal year, $400 billion higher than its February estimate.According to Paul Ashworth, Chief North American Economist at Capital Economics, the increase is due to higher net interest outlays, with the primary deficit unchanged at 3.6% of GDP.U.S. debt is on an unsustainable path higher, and the threat is only exacerbated by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy. In this environment, it’s no wonder everyone is turning to gold.That’s it for this week. Have a great weekend, and enjoy the start of summer!"
1,"Jun 21, 2024","Wall Street reaches perfect equilibrium of indecision on gold prices, Main Street maintains optimistic outlook","
(Kitco News) – The gold market saw one of its least dramatic weeks of the year this week, but as has been the case of late, it saved some drama for market participants for the end.
Spot gold kicked off the week trading at $2,332.64, and after sliding to a daily low of $2,311.50 around noon EDT on Monday, it did very little other than set the weekly low of $2,307.38 early Tuesday morning.
So steady and narrow was the sideways churn that by the middle of the day Wednesday, which also marked the Juneteenth holiday in the United States, gold had traded in only about a $20 range and found itself flat on the week.
U.S. traders brought renewed energy to the markets with their return on Thursday morning, driving spot gold from $2,332 in the early morning to the then-high of $2,364.09 by 10:45 am EDT. Gold then traded in its newly elevated range between $2,350 and the weekly high of $2,367.70 until Friday morning’s precipitous decline that saw spot gold slide from $2,363.71 at 9 am EDT all the way to $2,317.70 shortly after 1 pm, leaving traders and investors wondering whether the key psychological support level of $2,300 per ounce would hold into Friday's close.

The latest Kitco News Weekly Gold Survey shows industry experts indecisive about gold’s near-term path, while retail sentiment remains positive.
Marc Chandler, Managing Director at Bannockburn Global Forex, sees geopolitics pushing bullion prices higher next week. 
“US rates remain soft and although Mexico’s president-elect has made some market-friendly cabinet appointments, political tensions continue to run high in Europe (EU, France, and UK),” he said. “And we note elevated tension between China and the Philippines.”
Chandler said the slippage in U.S. rates “seems to run against the grain of the rally in crude oil, where the Aug WTI contract reached its highest level since the end of April.”
“The yellow metal is testing the $2368 area, and a push higher could see $2388-$2390,” he concluded.
“BULL,” wrote Mark Leibovit, publisher of the VR Metals/Resource Letter.
“Down,” countered Adrian Day, President of Adrian Day Asset Management. “Gold is in a short-term trading range right now and, after last week’s rally, could pull back next week. The market is in a holding pattern, looking for news on the resumption of Chinese official gold buying as well as clarity on US inflation and employment, which will provide insight into the timing of any rate cut.”
Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst at Barchart.com, sees gold prices trending higher next week.
“August gold’s short-term uptrend has turned up on the contract’s daily chart, with August posting a new 4-day high of $2,5379.50 Thursday,” Newsom wrote. “While the early part of next week could see renewed light selling interest, by the time we get to next Friday, the contract should be higher again.”
Newsom said he’s looking for a higher weekly close this week and next, which would constitute a string of three straight weeks against the intermediate-term downtrend on the August contract’s weekly chart. “At that point, based on the Benjamin Franklin Fish Analogy (Like guests and fish, markets start to stink after three days/week/months of moving against the trend), I’m looking for the futures contract to turn down again,” he said.
“The short-term upside target area is between $2,370 and $2,390, with an outside shot at $2,410.”
Analysts at CPM Group are also projecting higher gold prices over the next week or two.
“A wide range of political, economic, and financial market issues are likely to push gold higher, toward $2,400 if not $2,450 during this time,” they said. “A stronger dollar is not likely to be a negative for gold: The dollar and gold are both expected to find strong investor demand as the safer currencies to be in. Silver prices are expected to exhibit strength next week ahead of the July Comex futures delivery period starting on 28 May, which may help pull gold prices higher.”
“The increase may be short-lived, however, and dissipate beyond the first week of July,” the analysts warned.
This week, 14 Wall Street analysts participated in the Kitco News Gold Survey, and their responses produced a perfect equilibrium of indecision about the near-term prospects for precious metals. Five experts, representing 62%, expect to see gold prices climb higher next week, while an equal number of analysts predict a price decline. The remaining four, or 28% of the total, expect gold to trade sideways during the coming week.
Meanwhile, 209 votes were cast in Kitco’s online poll, with Main Street investors maintaining their positive outlook on the yellow metal. 114 retail traders, or 55%, look for gold prices to rise next week. Another 38, or 18%, expected the yellow metal to trade lower, while 57 respondents, representing the remaining 27%, saw prices chopping sideways during the week ahead.

The highlight of next week's economic news calendar is the release of the core PCE price index report for May, as markets will be very interested to see if the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation shows further improvement, increasing the likelihood of interest rate cuts in 2024.
Markets will also receive U.S. consumer confidence for June, the S&P Case Shiller home price index for April on Tuesday, and MBA mortgage applications, new home sales, and the results of the Federal Reserve’s bank stress tests on Wednesday. Thursday will bring the May durable goods report and final Q1 GDP, along with initial jobless claims and pending home sales for May, and the week wraps up with the final University of Michigan consumer sentiment for June on Friday.
There will also be a battery of central bank speakers for markets to tune in to, including the Fed's Waller and Daly on Monday, speeches from Cook and Bowman on Tuesday, and Barkin and Bowman again on Friday.
Daniel Pavilonis, Senior Commodities Broker at RJO Futures, said gold appears to be in its summer doldrums, but there’s a lot more happening under the surface.
“If you look at the retracement of the dollar, the dollar is still moving higher, we're inching our way up there, and we're also looking at energy prices move higher,” he said. “This could cause a rebound in rates, which may put some pressure on gold.”
“But ultimately, we're going to see some major headwinds here coming into the elections, and possibly some flaring up of rates in Europe with the situation in France, and French yields moving higher because of the elections.”
“At the base of it, everywhere you look, in terms of de-dollarization, rates, debt, political instability, I still think this is very, very beneficial for gold,” he said. “But it may take a little bit of a pause here.”
Regarding gold’s slide on Friday, Pavilonis said he thinks it was likely driven by hawkish Fed commentary.
“I think some of it was the Fed talk yesterday, with Brainard, on the possibility of not cutting rates,” he said. “Then, coming into this morning, we had some European data that was maybe weighing on the markets, but then we had the global composite PMI and manufacturing PMI, and I think that ticked a little bit higher.”
Pavilonis said the data is inconclusive right now, and it’s creating a weird situation for market participants. “Are we walking into a recession because rates are too tight, or are they not tight enough?” he asked rhetorically. “Some of the data is just all over the place, and I think it's causing a little bit of uncertainty in the market.”
While Pavilonis sees a lot of global instability pushing gold prices higher in the coming months, as far as next week is concerned, he still thinks the yellow metal could fall further. 
“I still think there may be some downside,” he said. “We have that double top up there around $2,440. We come back and we try to make a new high, and we actually make a new low, and then we start grinding higher from the beginning of June, all the way to where we've been over the last couple of days… but the candlesticks on the daily [chart] on futures don't look that great.”
“I think the path of least resistance is to the downside,” he concluded. “Maybe we start getting back down to $2,250, somewhere around there.”
Michael Moor, founder of Moor Analytics, wrote that based on where gold is trading on Friday, the charts are indicating further downside.
“The trade above 23386 (-1.2 tics per/hour) should bring in decent strength,” he said. “Decent trade back below 23520 (-2 tics per/hour starting at 6:00am) should bring in decent pressure. Decent trade below 23249 (+1 tic per/hour) will project this downward $35 minimum.”
And Kitco Senior Analyst Jim Wyckoff said traders appear to be positioning themselves long for next week.
“The near-term technical postures have turned more bullish for gold and silver this week, which is inviting the chart-based speculators to the long sides of the markets,” he said. “Technically, August gold bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at the June high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the June low of $2,304.20.”
“First resistance is seen at $2,390.00 and then at $2,400.00,” Wyckoff said. “First support is seen at the overnight low of $2,368.60 and then at $2,300.00.”
Spot gold last traded at $2322.89 at the time of writing for a loss of 1.59% on the day and 0.41% on the week.

2,"Jun 21, 2024","NY Fed warns of risk to major U.S. banks, 'something amiss in the banking system,' says Soloway","(Kitco News) - There is something ""amiss"" in the U.S. banking sector, says Gareth Soloway, Chief Market Strategist at VerifiedInvesting.com, warning that big institutional players are ""unloading"" the stocks of big banks.
""I'm hearing a lot of chatter about the big banks unloading bad debt right now, trying to get ahead of some sort of crisis looming,"" Soloway tells Michelle Makori, Lead Anchor and Editor-in-Chief at Kitco News. ""Because interest rates are so high, the amount of losses in mortgage-backed securities potentially rival what we saw in 2008 and 2009. In addition, the commercial real estate market is in tatters. And these are all things that banks are holding on their balance sheets.""
       
 
Soloway points to the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE), noting the formation of a bear flag pattern since the banking crisis lows of April last year. Watch the video above for Soloway's breakdown.
There has also been a technical breakdown in the stocks of some of the bigger banks, including JPMorgan, according to Soloway.
""This trend line breakdown just started on JPMorgan, Citigroup has already broken down,"" Soloway added. ""There are signs that something is amiss within the banking system, whether it's the bear flag in the KRE or in these bigger banks. There are some bigger players that are unloading the big banks here.""
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell commented on the banking sector at the June press conference following the central bank's two-day monetary policy meeting.
""The banking system has been solid, strong, well-capitalized lending. We've seen good performance by the banks. We had turmoil early last year, but banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity, bringing up their capital, and having risk management plans in place. So, the banking system seems to be in good shape,"" Powell said.
Soloway reacted to Powell's comment by pointing out that the Fed Chair would never come out and say there is a big issue in the banking system. ""Think about the fire that would spread in the market crash that would ensue if he said that,"" Soloway noted.
Soloway's warning comes as the New York Fed's Liberty Street Economics blog cautioned of U.S. big banks facing growing spillover risks from non-banks.
During periods of increased market volatility, liquidity demand accelerates, putting pressure on banks as non-banks look for loans and lines of credit. This could trigger ""vectors of shock transmission and amplification, forcing authorities to intervene and do so en masse,"" the post said, adding that the disruptions ""could be rather severe.""
At the same time, the Federal Reserve pointed to weaknesses in four of the biggest banks on Wall Street regarding how they would handle their own failures.
According to a joint statement released Friday by the U.S. central bank and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the regulators spotted shortcomings in the so-called ""living wills"" of JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs Group, and Citigroup.
""For the four banks with an identified shortcoming, the letters describe the specific weaknesses resulting in the shortcoming and the remedial actions required by the agencies,"" the agencies said.
Soloway also revealed the black swan event investors need to pay close attention to in the year's second half. Watch the video above for insights.
In addition, Soloway shared his technical analysis of gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Watch the video above for his short-term and long-term price forecasts.

3,"Jun 21, 2024",Expect a volatile gold price as the summer trading season kicks off,"(Kitco News) - Commodity analysts remain extremely bullish on gold over the long term; however, as the summer trading season kicks off, investors should not expect to see a breakout rally anytime soon.
Despite the positive sentiment, gold remains caught in a relatively narrow trading range. It has been unable to hold sustainable gains above $2,350 an ounce. On the downside, the precious metal has managed to hold support at around $2,300 an ounce.
Despite a solid start to the week, gold is heading into the weekend with a loss. August gold futures last traded at $2,331.80 an ounce, down 0.7% from last Friday.
Chantelle Schieven, Head of Research at Capitalight Research, said investors should brace for higher volatility in the gold market. She explained that traditionally, summer markets see lower liquidity, which can generate higher volatility. At the same time, market uncertainty remains extremely elevated as markets try to guess the Federal Reserve’s next move.
“Gold is kind of stuck here, and it's reacting to everything because we just don’t know what the Federal Reserve is going to do,” she said. “Every piece of data that comes outside of expectations has been enough to shift interest rate expectations back and forth, driving gold up and down.”
Although gold is treading water, Schieven said that it is important to pay attention to the broader landscape. She said gold has established a solid floor around $2,280 an ounce. She added that she is looking for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September to support the economy, even as inflation pressures remain elevated.
“The big takeaway I have gotten from the Federal Reserve’s latest comments is that they are not as worried about inflation and are now shifting their focus to the labor market,” she said. “Underlying activity in the labor market is weak, and that will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut rates after the summer.”
Naeem Aslam, Chief Investment Officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said he expects gold to remain well-supported in the near term as traders use the precious metal to hedge their positions ahead of their summer vacations.
However, Aslam added that he doesn’t see any breakout on the horizon.
“We continue to maintain our stance that the path of the least resistance would continue to remain for consolidation unless we experience more noise from the FOMC members,” he said.
Although gold has been unable to hold gains above $2,350 for the last five weeks, David Morrison, Senior Market Analyst at Trade Nation, said he remains constructive on gold.
He noted that the market’s consolidation has taken a lot of the froth out of the market.
“The recent moves in gold look quite constructive despite today’s sell-off. The metal has been grinding higher ever since the sell-off two weeks ago following the strong payroll report. Support around $2,300 is holding, and the daily MACD has leveled out just below neutral levels and looks to be turning higher,” Morrison said in a comment to Kitco. “The large swings that we’re now seeing in both gold and silver are exactly the kind of gyrations to expect ahead of a big move. These will be exacerbated as we get further into the summer, as trading volumes get thinner.""
However, not all analysts are optimistic that gold can maintain these elevated levels.  Barbara Lambrecht, Commodity Analyst at Commerzbank, said the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to signal the start of a new easing cycle.
“As the first interest rate cut in the US will probably not take place until the end of the year, further upside potential is likely to be limited,” said Lambrecht in a note Friday. “What's more, gold ETFs have recently recorded renewed outflows. It is, therefore also worth taking a look at the market positioning of speculative financial investors after their net long positions rose to their highest level since spring 2020 in the last reporting week. The high optimism of these investors could lead to a setback in the gold price.”
Although the economic calendar is a little light next week, there will be enough reports to create some volatility in gold. The focus next week will be on Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.
Some analysts have said that weak inflation data could solidify a September rate cut, which would support gold prices.
Economic data to watch next week:
Tuesday: U.S. Consumer ConfidenceWednesday: U.S. New Home salesThursday: Final Q1 GPD, weekly jobless claims, Core Durable Goods, U.S. Pending Home sales.Friday: PCE Price Index, personal income and spending"
4,"Jun 21, 2024",Gold drops to session lows as combined flash PMI data hits 26-month high,"(Kitco News) -The gold market is holding support above $2,350 an ounce but is seeing some renewed selling pressure as both the U.S. manufacturing and service sectors see healthy activity in June.
Friday, S&P Global said its preliminary Purchasing Managers Index for the manufacturing sector rose to 51.7, from May’s reading of 51.3.  Activity in the manufacturing sector was better than expected, as economists forecasted a relatively neutral reading at 51.0.
The report said that activity in the manufacturing sector has risen to a three-month high.
However,  the report noted an even more significant recovery within the service sector. The services PMI increased to 55.1, up from May’s reading of 54.8. According to consensus forecasts, economists projected a modest drop to 53.4.
The report said that activity in the service sector has risen to a 26-month high.
“US business activity growth accelerated to its fastest for 26 months in June, according to provisional PMI survey data from S&P Global, signaling a strong end to the second quarter. The service sector led the upturn with additional support from manufacturing, albeit with the latter’s recent revival losing some momentum,” the report said.
The gold market has dropped its session lows but still holds support above a critical physiological level. August gold futures last traded at $2,350.10 an ounce, down 0.79% on the day.
Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the data suggests that the U.S. economy is expanding by 2.5%.
“The upturn is broad-based, as rising demand continues to filter through the economy. Although led by the service sector, reflecting strong domestic spending, the expansion is being supported by an ongoing recovery in manufacturing, which so far this year is enjoying its best growth spell for two years,” he said.
In further good news for consumers, Williamson noted that the improved activity is not causing inflation to heat up.
“Selling price inflation has meanwhile cooled again after ticking higher in May, down to one of the lowest levels seen over the past four years. Historical comparisons indicate that the latest decline brings the survey’s price gauge into line with the Fed’s 2% inflation target,” he said."

Silver prices are lower after notching a two-week peak overnight. The near-term technical postures have turned more bullish for gold and silver this week, which is inviting the chart-based speculators to the long sides of the markets. The weaker U.S. retail sales report earlier this week and some downbeat economic data out of the Eurozone today have more in the marketplace thinking the Federal Reserve and other major central banks will be able to ease their monetary policies in the next few months, or even sooner. August gold was last up $11.10 at $2,380.00. July silver was last down $0.246 at $30.575.
Asian and European stock indexes were mostly weaker overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward weaker openings when the New York day session begins. Angus Campbell of TradeNation reported in an email dispatch this morning that Thursday’s NVIDIA-led sell-off in the U.S. stock indexes spilled over into selling in Asia and Europe. European stock indexes also sold off following end-of-week disappointing flash manufacturing and services purchasing managers indexes (PMI) from across the Eurozone. “There wasn’t a single reading that managed to beat expectations or that came in above last month’s numbers,” said Campbell.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index firmer. Nymex crude oil prices are near steady and trading around $81.25 a barrel after hitting a seven-week high Thursday. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently 4.24%.
U.S. economic data due for release Friday includes the U.S. flash and services purchasing managers indexes (PMI), existing home sales and leading economic indicators.

7,"Jun 20, 2024",Monetary Metals offers a silver bond for the first time in over 150 years,"(Kitco News) - Although gold's allure as a global commodity is growing as central banks buy the precious metal at an unprecedented pace, it is not the only monetary metal on the market.
Central banks stopped accumulating silver in the mid-1850s, and the world moved off the silver standard by the early 1870s; however, many still see the grey metal as an important financial tool for wealth protection.
One company is looking to bring back silver's luster as a full-fledged monetary metal, as Monetary Metals has launched a new silver bond. In an exclusive interview with Kitco News, Monetary Metals CEO Keith Weiner said that he suspects this is the first silver-based financial loan created in more than 150 years.
The silver loan will support Bunker Hill Mining Corp. as it raises capital to restart and further develop its operations at its Bunker Hill Mine in Idaho. Over its nearly 100 years of operation, the mine produced 165 million ounces of silver.
This loan is unique because it will be paid entirely in physical silver. Under the terms of the agreement, accredited investors will earn a 12% annual yield on the bond over three years. 
Weiner explained that under the agreement, investors could loan out 1,000 ounces of silver and, in three years, would get back 1,360 ounces. 
""It's pretty exciting to offer a silver bond for the first time in 150 years,"" said Weiner. ""We are showing the world that silver is still an important monetary metal. It's not about a new gold standard or silver standard; it's about creating a gold and silver standard. This is the grand experiment we are demonstrating.""
Weiner added that silver is an attractive monetary asset because it is readily available with an ample supply of above-ground stocks; at the same time, its low price tag compared to gold means it is accessible to a broader range of investors.
""If you look at the two metals, gold and silver, each one is oriented differently,"" he said. ""Silver is much better for small savers.""
The launch of Monetary Metals' new silver bond comes as the gray metal's price has seen a significant run, pushing to a 12-year high above $32 an ounce last month.
Although silver has since dropped into a consolidation pattern, it has managed to hold critical support above its 50-day moving average of around $29 an ounce. Weiner doesn't concern himself too much with the dollar price in silver, saying that the market would have to drop significantly lower to outweigh the returns on a 12% annual yield.
""I think we are starting to see silver attract more investors, and it is likely to outperform gold in this new bull market,"" Weiner said. 
The Monetary Metals silver bond is set to be launched on Friday, June 28."
8,"Jun 20, 2024","Gold, silver rally on bargain hunting, technical buying","(Kitco News) - Gold prices are firmly up and silver sharply higher in midday U.S. trading Thursday. Both metals touched nearly two-week highs. Perceived bargain hunting and technical buying are featured as gold and silver chart postures have turned more bullish late this week. The precious metals bulls are also more confident following the weaker U.S. retail sales report earlier this week. A Barron’s headline today reads: “The Fed needs to cut rates eventually amid this economic slowdown.” August gold was last up $21.60 at $2,368.70. July silver was last up $1.151 at $30.72.
Switzerland’s central bank Thursday unexpectedly cut its main interest rates for a second consecutive time to 1.25%. This news also benefited the metals market bulls, on ideas of easing monetary policies from the world’s major central banks.
In other overnight news, China bank officials kept one- and five-year prime loan rates unchanged at 3.45% and 3.95%, respectively. This follows the central bank decision to leave its benchmark one-year medium term lending rate at 2.50% earlier this month.Meantime, the Bank of England today kept its rates steady at 5.25%.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index higher. Nymex crude oil prices are firmer and hit a seven-week high today, trading around $82.00 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently around 4.28%.

Technically, August gold bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at the June high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the June low of $2,304.20.

9,"Jun 20, 2024","Gold price testing resistance at $2,350 but largely ignores 5.5% drop in U.S. housing starts","(Kitco News) - The U.S. housing sector continues to struggle as the construction of new homes falls to its lowest level in nine months.
The gold market is not seeing much reaction to the disappointing data, as the price manages to push above initial resistance at $2,350 an ounce.
Housing starts dropped 5.5% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.277 million units, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. The data came in lower than expected, as economists looked for a rate of 1.37 million units.
Meanwhile, the report said that housing construction compared to last year is down nearly 20%.
The gold market continues to consolidate as it pays little attention to economic data. August gold futures last traded at $2,350.50 an ounce, up 0.15% on the day.
At the same time, a further decline in building permits issued last month does not bode well for a sustained recovery in the housing market anytime soon. The report said that building permits for future homebuilding declined 3.8% to a rate of 1.386 million last month, compared to April’s revised estimate of 1.444 million permits.  
The issuance of building permits is down 9.5% for the year.
Although the latest housing data continues to disappoint, it has not surprised many economists as the sector faces some significant headwinds.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy stance has kept mortgage rates elevated. At the same time, a lack of supply has pushed home prices higher, pricing many potential home buyers out of the marketplace.
Relief for the housing market could come after the summer as markets expect the U.S. central bank to cut rates in September."
10,"Jun 20, 2024","Price gains in gold, silver on ideas of easier central bankers   ","(Kitco News) - Gold prices are modestly up and silver sharply higher in early U.S. trading Thursday.

12,"Jun 20, 2024",Gold holding modest gains; sees little movement as BoE leaves rates unchanged at 5.25%,"(Kitco News) (Kitco News) - Gold is holding on to modest gains against the British pound even as the Bank of England continues to hold rates steady in restrictive territory.
As expected, the BoE left its Bank Rate unchanged at 5.25% Thursday; the vote on the decision also fell in line with expectations. Two members preferred to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points to 5%, with seven voting to hold firm.
The BoE's latest monetary policy decision is not having much of an impact on gold, which last traded at £1,841.73 an ounce, up 0.49%.
Some analysts were holding out some hope that weaker inflation pressures would encourage the BOE to cut at today's meeting. The central bank acknowledged that inflation last month fell to its 2% target but maintained a cautious stance.
""Indicators of short-term inflation expectations have also continued to moderate, particularly for households. CPI inflation is expected to rise slightly in the second half of this year, as declines in energy prices last year fall out of the annual comparison,"" the central bank said in its monetary policy statement.
Despite the bank's stance, some monetary policy committee members acknowledged that Thursday's decision was ""finely balanced.""
While the BoE continues to hold the line on interest rates, analysts expect it's only a matter of time before it starts to ease, in line with other major central banks.
""The next move in Bank Rate remains likely to be a cut, probably at the next meeting in August, as the MPC continue to 'keep under review' how long to maintain the current level of restriction. Such a cut, however, hinges on the disinflation process continuing, and the June CPI figures not bringing any nasty surprises. That said, such a cut is unlikely to be a unanimous decision, with the MPC's hawks likely still concerned about intense earnings pressures, and sticky services prices. These concerns should, more broadly, see the pace of policy normalisation after the first cut remain relatively gradual, with just one further 25bp cut, probably in November, the base case for the remainder of 2024,"" said Michael Brown, Senior Research Analyst at Pepperstone. "
13,"Jun 19, 2024",Gold and silver caught in prolonged consolidation but prices will head higher - Saxo Bank,"
(Kitco News) - Although gold and silver are stuck in neutral at elevated levels, one market analyst remains a long-term bull on precious metals.
Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, published a report Tuesday saying investors and traders are just catching their breath after the market’s nearly $250 rally from its February lows to its peak above $2450 an ounce last month.
Hansen added that although gold has lost some momentum, there is very little bearish sentiment in the marketplace as investors and money managers see no urgency to take profits.
He explained that many hedge funds jumped into gold when prices were still below $2,200 an ounce. This sentiment is helping gold hold sticky support at around $2,300 an ounce.
“It is clear that the bulk of the run-up in prices back in February and March was supported by strong demand from managed money traders, such as hedge funds. Having joined the rally at an early stage, they have subsequently not been forced to adjust (sell) positions as the current correction phase has kept prices above levels that otherwise would have forced them to reduce their exposure,” he said in the report.
“Getting on board early and at much lower levels helps explain why the current gold volatility is relatively low compared with other metals such as silver, platinum, and copper, where speculators joined a bit later and at higher prices, leaving them more exposed to long liquidation and with that, the risk of a deeper correction,” Hansen added.
Looking ahead, Hansen said that one of the biggest pillars of support in the marketplace comes from gold’s role as a safe-haven asset and hedge against market risks as geopolitical uncertainty continues to impact the global economy.
At the same time, Hansen said that growing sovereign debt is also forcing central banks to continue to diversify their foreign reserves away from the U.S. dollar.
As to how long gold and silver’s prolonged consolidation will last, Hansen said that is up to the Federal Reserve. He noted that while retail investors in Asia and central banks continue to support the market, it is still missing a key component: investor demand.
“Gold and silver continue to see limited interest from ETF investors who have remained mostly net sellers since 2022 when the FOMC began its aggressive rate-hiking campaign, raising the cost of carry, or opportunity cost, of holding a non-coupon-paying metal investment. Demand from ETF investors will likely remain subdued until interest rates are lowered, and this cost is reduced,” he said."
14,"Jun 19, 2024",Can silver prices sustain slowing momentum in the green energy transition?,"
(Kitco News) - Industrial demand increases from the global green energy transition propelled silver prices to a 12-year high last month as demand has outstripped supply. However, this trend appears to be at risk after the World Economic Forum noted that momentum in the green energy transition is slowing.
In a report published Tuesday, the WEF said that while the global energy transition is still progressing, growing geopolitical uncertainty has caused it to lose momentum.
The report used the Energy Transition Index (ETI) to benchmark 120 countries on the performance of their current energy systems. In the current hierarchy, European countries dominated the top 10 rankings for 2024, with Sweden and Denmark coming in first and second, respectively. At the same time, the report also noted that global average ETI scores reached a record high this year, but growth has slowed.
“The 2024 report shows that the three-year improvement in global ETI scores between 2021-2024 is almost four times less than the upswing over the 2018-2021 period,” the report said. “Furthermore, the report indicates that 83% of countries achieved lower scores than last year on at least one of the primary performance dimensions of the energy transition – sustainability, equity, and security.”
“This year’s Energy Transition Index delivers a clear message: urgent action is needed,” said Espen Mehlum, Head of Energy Transition Intelligence and Regional Acceleration, World Economic Forum. “Global decision-makers must make bold moves to regain momentum in the transition towards an equitable, secure, and sustainable energy future. This is critical for people, entire economies, and the fight against climate change.”
While there is still more work to be done, the report noted that the gap in overall ETI scores between advanced and developing economies has narrowed and the “center of gravity” of the transition is shifting to developing countries.
However, the report also suggested that advanced nations need to provide financial support for emerging markets to create an equitable global energy transition.
Silver has played a critical role in the green energy transition as it is essential to the production of photovoltaic solar panels. According to some reports, the average solar cell uses roughly 111 milligrams of silver. Due to thrifting, the amount of silver used has declined sharply; however, analysts have said that this trend has run its course and the amount of silver needed is unlikely to decline further.
Looking at the broader market, solar power represents a massive component of the green energy transition. Investment in this sector now accounts for approximately 40 percent of global investment in energy transition manufacturing, reaching $80 billion in 2023. Demand for silver is expected to continue to increase, with the Silver Institute estimating demand could rise by as much as 170% by 2030."
15,"Jun 19, 2024",SoGen is not giving up any of its gold before the U.S. elections in November ,"(Kitco News) - The geopolitical uncertainty pushing nations to diversify away from the U.S. dollar is a good reason for investors to maintain a core position in gold, according to one international bank.
Wednesday, French Bank Société Générale published its third-quarter Multi-Asset Portfolio Strategy where it announced that it is maintaining a 5% holding in gold, even as it reduces its overall commodity exposure.
The updated positioning shows a two percentage point drop in its broader commodity basket, from 9% to 7%, as the bank remains concerned about oil prices. The analysts said they are bearish on oil as they believe OPEC+ nations will be unable to maintain their production cuts.
“We foresee a growing probability that OPEC, particularly Saudi Arabia, switches into the will to regain lost market share at multi decade low, like they did at the end of 1985 or 2014. We’re clearly bearish oil, which should prevent one to be too cautious on its investment profile,” the analyst said.
Meanwhile, SogGen said that it is not looking to change its gold holdings ahead of the U.S. elections in November.
“Decisions to freeze for an indefinite time USD assets of the Russia central bank will enforce multi-year buying of gold by central banks of the global south to protect their reserves. Ahead of the U.S. election, we keep a heavy weight in gold,” the analysts said.
The analysts said they don’t expect gold’s uptrend to correct anytime soon, even as prices consolidate below $2,350 an ounce.
“Gold has been one of the top returning assets in the first part of the year, ranking between Japan and US equities,” the analysts said. “Overbuying, inflation stickiness, widening public deficits, geopolitics, and diversification by central banks/monetary authorities underpin our long-held bullish view on the metal.”
SocGen’s downgrade of the broader commodity market comes as it looks to free up cash and increase its exposure to corporate bonds. Along with its shift in commodities, the bank also decreased its cash holdings to 10% from 14% in the second quarter.
Meanwhile, with recession fears fading, the bank has increased its private credit exposure to 21% from 15%.
Despite these adjustments, the bank said it is maintaining the overall stance it has held since the start of the year.
“MAP has been correctly holding assets that have performed well (Japan equities, Gold, US equities; overall nearly 40% of the portfolio) and underweighting those that have performed poorly (government bonds and inflation; overall just 15% of the portfolio). It has been a broadly stable allocation,” the analysis said in the report. “Over the last 12 months, as the balance has shifted from bonds to equities, we have adjusted the portfolio but not fundamentally changed it.”
“The reason is that we have remained in the same market chapter – a plateau (or call it high for longer),” they added. “We believe that we are still in the same sequence and accordingly maintain a balanced allocation.”
The analyst said they don’t expect to see any material shift in the portfolio until the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. They also noted that given the U.S. economy’s resilient strength, the U.S. central bank might not start cutting rates until 2025."
16,"Jun 18, 2024","Gold, silver lifted by downbeat U.S. economic data, rally in oil","(Kitco News) - Gold prices are higher and silver prices slightly up in midday U.S. trading Tuesday. Gold got a boost after a weaker U.S. economic report was released earlier this morning. A rally in the crude oil market to a six-week high today is also a bullish outside-market element for the metals markets. August gold was last up $13.30 at $2,342.30. July silver was last up $0.079 at $29.47.
Today’s U.S. retail sales report for May showed a gain of 0.1%, month-on-month, versus expectations for a rise of 0.2%. April sales were revised down from unchanged to -0.2%, month-on-month. Today’s weaker sales data falls into the camp of the U.S. monetary policy hawks, who want to see the Federal Reserve cut interest rates sooner rather than later. CNBC’s chief economics reporter Steve Liesman called today retail sales report very important as the data, including the April revisions, suggests U.S. economic growth is slowing and not accelerating.
U.S. stock indexes are mixed at midday. Despite the U.S. federal holiday on Wednesday, when U.S. markets are closed, it’s still a busy week for U.S. data.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index slightly down after the downbeat retail sales report. Nymex crude oil prices are firmer and hit a six-week high today.

Technically, August gold bulls and bears are on a level overall near-term technical playing field amid recent choppy trading. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at the June high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the June low of $2,304.20. First resistance is seen at $2,350.00 and then at $2,358.80.

17,"Jun 18, 2024",Gold meets digital dollars: Tether launches aUSD₮ – a stablecoin with gold backing,"
(Kitco News) – Tether, the company responsible for issuing USDT, the top stablecoin by market cap, continues to expand beyond fait-backed stablecoins with the launch of Alloy by Tether, a new asset-backed token that uses Tether Gold (XAU₮) as collateral.  
 
“Developed by Moon Gold NA, S.A. de C.V. and Moon Gold El Salvador, S.A. de C.V., both of whom are members of the Tether Group, Alloy by Tether aims to redefine stability in the digital economy by combining the strengths of a stable unit of account with the security and reliability of gold,” the company said in a press release. 
 
“We are thrilled to announce the launch of Alloy by Tether, introducing a class of digital assets backed by gold and tethered to a reference fiat currency,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether.  “While the stabilization mechanism is different compared to traditional options like USD₮, this innovative solution marks an exciting milestone, and we eagerly anticipate how it will interact with the rest of the market. Moreover, we plan to make this innovative technology available in our upcoming digital asset tokenization platform as well.”
 
The new Alloy token is similar to other tethered assets in that it is designed to track the price of reference assets – in this case, XAU₮ – “through stabilization strategies like over-collateralization with liquid assets and secondary market liquidity pools,” Tether said. “This innovative approach provides consistent value and stability between the reference asset and its tethered counterpart.”
 
The company said Alloy by Tether will eventually contain multiple tokens, the first of which will be aUSD₮, a digital currency designed to track the value of one US dollar. 
 
“What makes aUSD₮ unique is that it is over-collateralized by Tether Gold (XAU₮), which means it is supported by real physical gold stored in Switzerland,” Tether said. “Users can create aUSD₮ tokens using Tether Gold as collateral.”
 
The token’s design aims to give users who want to engage in digital transactions, payments, and remittances with a currency that feels as familiar as the U.S. dollar the ability to do so without having to sell their XAU₮.
 
“Currently, Alloy by Tether smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet,” Tether said. “Users can mint aUSD₮ by depositing Tether Gold as collateral through a process managed by Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. The aUSD₮ smart contract ensures transparency by keeping track of all collateral and minted tokens, using Price Oracles to constantly evaluate the Mint to Value (MTV) ratio.”
 
The new aUSD₮ token is the first in a planned series of tokens to be released via Alloy by Tether, “an open platform that allows the creation of different tethered assets with broader backing mechanics, potentially including yield-bearing products,” they said. “This technology provides a modern approach to asset management for institutions as well by offering a secure, gold-backed digital asset that can be integrated into portfolios.”
 
Moon Gold NA, S.A. de C.V., and Moon Gold El Salvador, S.A. de C.V., which are both authorized by the CNAD in El Salvador, will oversee the issuance and management of aUSD₮ and will be able to cater to different customer segments and regulatory requirements, Tether said. "
18,"Jun 18, 2024",Gold price to churn for the next six months and then rally back to record highs - Wells Fargo,"
(Kitco News) - Investors need to be patient when it comes to gold. According to one U.S. bank, the precious metal could continue to consolidate through the summer as markets come to terms with the Federal Reserve’s holding pattern.
In an interview with Kitco News, John LaForge, Head of Real Asset Strategy at the bank, said that he does not expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates until the final months of the year. He added that the market is seeing solid signs that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policies have reached their limit.
Until then, LaForge said that the market will be at the mercy of its natural ebbs and flows in retail markets. He pointed out that consumers in Asia, led by Chinese and Indian buyers, have been significant drivers for the physical bullion market, supporting prices near-record levels.
However, he added that this momentum could be reaching its limit as these consumers face a combination of elevated gold prices and weaker domestic currencies due to the resilient strength of the U.S. dollar.
“If you're an Indian consumer, all of a sudden, year-to-date, your gold has become 30% more expensive,” he said. “Generally, what we find with consumers is they don't stop buying. They just buy a little bit less. That’s why I think gold might churn for a little bit over the next six months.”
According to the bank’s updated mid-year price forecasts, gold prices are expected to trade between $2,300 and $2,400 an ounce. The range is expected to increase to $2,400 and $2,500 an ounce by the end of 2025.
Looking ahead, while some investors are waiting for the Federal Reserve to embark on an easing cycle before they jump back into the gold market, LaForge said that it doesn’t have to be that explicit.
LaForge stated that any kind of liquidity event or quantitative easing would be enough to drive gold prices up to all-time highs.
“It may take one or two years, but the writing is on the wall when looking at interest rates. Rates can’t go much higher,” he said. “Higher interest rates will become a major problem for governments that have to deal with elevated debt levels. There will be pressure to ensure rates don’t start to climb. It’s not just in the U.S. debt is piling up around the globe, which is why you see so many central banks turning to gold.”
Although Western retail investors continue to wait for the right moment to jump into the gold market, LaForge said he doesn’t see that hesitation among official gold buyers. He added that he expects central banks to continue buying gold as there are still years left in this new commodity supercycle.
He explained that in the current environment, nations will continue to diversify into gold to protect their wealth and purchasing power as higher commodity prices keep inflation pressures stubbornly elevated.
“As long as debt is an issue, gold will remain an option on the table,” he said.
While LaForge sees solid potential for gold and silver through 2025, he said investors should maintain a well-diversified portfolio of commodities.
“Essentially, what bull supercycles are about is that there is not enough supply to meet demand. Generally, you can look at it as a tide that lifts all boats, and the worst strategic move you can make is to try to get too cute and pick one asset over another,” he said. “Rule one: own a basket of professionally managed commodities.”
Breaking down a dollar investment in the commodity market, LaForge said that 50 cents should make up the broad basket. With the other half of the investment, he added that investors can get a little more specific.
“Because debt and interest rates are a big part of this particular cycle, if you're going to be cute, I would do it in precious metals,” he said.
With the leftover 50 cents, LaForge said he would invest half of it in gold and the other half in a mix of silver and platinum to capture some aggressive upside momentum.
LaForge’s bullish outlook on precious metals comes as Wells Fargo publishes its mid-year outlook. The bank’s top analysts have said that while they don’t expect to see a collapse in the U.S. and global economies, now is the time to get a little more defensive.
The bank said that rising geopolitical uncertainty ahead of the November U.S. elections poses some risks for financial markets in the second half of the year.
Looking ahead, the bank noted that interest rate expectations are falling in line with its initial estimates. In December, the analysts said that a potential six rate cuts this year was too extreme. Wells Fargo was looking for around two rate cuts this year."
19,"Jun 18, 2024","Supply constraints, demand growth are bullish for both sides of the gold:silver ratio – CME Group’s Norland","
(Kitco News) – While there are several key factors that impact gold and silver prices differently, new demand growth for both precious metals and the paucity of new supply means both are likely to continue increasing in value, according to Erik Norland, Executive Director and Senior Economist at CME Group.
The first gold and silver coins were minted 2600 years ago in the Anatolian Kingdom of Lydia, and this resulted in the earliest known instance of the gold:silver ratio. 
“Like any cross rate, the amount of silver that can be purchased with an ounce of gold is driven by both demand and supply-side factors, and the cross rate is anything other than stable,” Norland said. “Sadly, we don’t have the time series of the gold-silver ratio dating back to ancient times, but we do have data going back to the launch of gold futures on December 31, 1974. Since the mid-1970s, one ounce of gold bought anywhere from 17 ounces to as many as 123 ounces of silver.”

Aside from monetary policy, Norland listed four key factors that govern the gold-silver ratio: relative volatility and the silver beta; fabrication demand and technological change; gold’s use as a monetary asset; and Supply-side dynamics.
“To borrow an expression from the equity markets, silver is the high-beta version of gold,” Norland said. “First, silver and gold prices usually have a strong positive correlation. Since 2004, the one-year rolling correlation of their daily price moves has hovered around +0.8.”

Norland also pointed out that silver is more volatile than gold. “As such, when gold prices move up, silver tends to move up more, thereby lowering the gold-silver price ratio,” he said. “By contrast, during bear markets, the gold-silver ratio tends to rise. For example, when gold and silver prices peaked in September 2011, one ounce of gold bought fewer than 32 ounces of silver. In the ensuing bear market, the ratio rose to as high as 124 ounces of silver per ounce of gold.”
Norland noted that as gold and silver rallied early in the pandemic in 2020, the ratio fell by nearly 50% to 64. “In 2024, as both metals have rallied, silver has outperformed, rising 23% in the first five months of the year compared to 12% for the yellow metal,” he wrote.

The second major factor that impacts the gold:silver ratio is fabrication demand and technological change. “What is curious is that while gold and silver have rallied thus far in 2024, gold broke to new record highs of nearly $2,500 per ounce, whereas silver prices remain 40% below their twin 1980 and 2011 peaks despite having outperformed gold since 2020,” he noted. “The reason may lie in technological advances.”

Norland wrote that well before the first gold and silver coins were minted, both metals were already being used to make jewelry. “Even today, the primary use of both metals is to make jewellery,” he said. “Yet, thus far this century, silver has been buffeted by two sets of technological developments: the digital revolution and the energy transition. Both have impacted the relative gold-silver ratio.”In 1999, photography consumed 36.6% of the year’s silver supply, but by 2023, the rise of digital photography meant the sector used only 2.3% of the annual supply. “Meanwhile, silver’s use in electronics and batteries grew from 90 million ounces to 227.4 million ounces or from 12.3% to 22.7% of silver’s total annual supply, partially offsetting the decline in traditional photography, which may partially explain why silver has struggled to hit new highs in recent years even as gold has set records,” Norland wrote.“The good news for silver, however, is that it is finding new use in the energy transition,” he added. “Over the past few years silver has seen strong growth coming from solar panels, which accounted for 20% of 2023 silver demand, up from essentially nothing in 1999. Solar panels may explain in part why silver has recovered relative to gold since 2020.”

“By contrast, gold fabrication demand has shown itself to be immune from recent technological developments and is still overwhelmingly dominated by jewellery demand, with electronics, dental and other uses absorbing just 17% of annual gold mining supply,” Norland noted. “The differences in silver and gold fabrication demand underscores that gold is considered the purer of the two precious metals.”
Norland pointed out another key difference between the two metals. “[C]entral banks around the world treat gold as money while they largely ignore silver,” he wrote. “They hold a combined 36,700 metric tons of gold, the equivalent of 1.2 billion troy ounces or 13 years of global mining output. Moreover, central banks have been net buyers of gold every year since the global financial crisis.”

He also pointed out that central banks have been net buyers of gold since 2009, whereas they were net sellers from 1982 to 2007.
“Central banks’ accumulation of gold suggests that they want a hard asset to complement their foreign exchange reserves of dollars, euros, yen, and other fiat currencies, a view that appears to have been reinforced by on-and-off quantitative easing since 2009 and increased use of financial sanctions,” Norland noted. “Central bank buying impacts gold prices directly, but only boosts silver prices indirectly via the gold market.”The final factor that governs the relative value of the two metals is supply, and here, as well, sovereign buying is having a significant impact, as it reduces the amount of gold available to the public.
“Over the past decade, central bank buying has removed the equivalent of 8%-20% of new mining supply from the gold market each year, which may also explain why the gold-silver ratio rose significantly from 2011 to 2020 and why, even today, it remains at 2x its 2011 level,” Norland wrote.

This new demand is running into long-term supply constraints. “Total gold supply net of official purchases has stagnated since 2003,” he said. “Meanwhile, silver mining supply peaked in 2016, and gold mining supply peaked the next year.”
“The fact that new supply is arriving on the market more slowly than in the past may be bullish for both gold and silver,” Norland noted.
The CME Group’s econometric analysis indicates that gold and silver prices are negatively correlated with changes to one another’s mining supply. “A 1% decrease in gold mining supply, on balance, boosted gold prices by 1.9% and silver by 3.0% from 1974 to 2023,” he wrote. “A 1% decrease in silver mining supply boosted the prices of the metals by 1.3%-1.6%.”

“Secondary supply appears to respond to price rather than drive it,” Norland concluded. “Higher prices incentivize more recycling, but recycled metal doesn’t appear to depress prices as it doesn’t bring any new metal onto the market.”Despite all the differences in supply, demand, and use, the two metals are connected though jewelry. “Because gold is 70x as costlier than silver when prices rise, demand for gold jewellery falls while silver’s jewellery demand is relatively unresponsive to price because it costs much less,” he added. “Gold and silver can be seen as a sort of binary star system where the two stars orbit a common center of gravity or barycenter. Gold is the larger, more stable and more influential of the two, but it is by no means immune from silver’s pull.”
The gold:silver ratio has strengthened in early trading on Tuesday, hitting a high of 79.873 a half-hour after the North American market open. It has since pulled back somewhat, last trading at 79.012 at the time of writing for a gain of 0.57% on the daily chart.

20,"Jun 18, 2024",Modest price gains for gold after weaker U.S. retail sales   ,"(Kitco News) - Gold prices are slightly up and silver slightly down in early U.S. trading Tuesday. Gold saw a modest boost after a downbeat U.S. economic report was released. August gold was last up $3.30 at $2,332.10. July silver was last down $0.191 at $29.195.
The just-released U.S. retail sales report for May showed a gain of 0.1%, month-on-month, versus expectations for a rise of 0.2%. April sales were revised down from unchanged to -0.2%, month-on-month. Today’s weaker sales data falls into the camp of the U.S. monetary policy hawks, who want to see the Federal Reserve cut interest rates sooner rather than later. CNBC’s chief economics reporter Steve Liesman called today retail sales report very important as the data, including the April revisions, suggests U.S. economic growth is slowing and not accelerating.
Asian and European stock indexes were mostly higher overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward mixed openings when the New York day session begins. Despite the U.S. federal holiday on Wednesday, when U.S. markets are closed, it’s still a busy week for U.S. data.
In overnight news, the Eurozone consumer price index for May was reported up 2.6%, year-on-year, which was right in line with market expectations.
Australia’s central bank left its monetary policy unchanged at its regular meeting Tuesday. The bank said inflation is easing slower than expected and remains too high.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index slightly up but did down-tick after the retail sales report. Nymex crude oil prices are near steady and trading around $80.25 a barrel after hitting a six-week high Monday. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently 4.24% and has down-ticked following the retail sales report.
Other U.S. economic data due for release Tuesday includes the weekly Johnson Redbook retail sales report, industrial production and capacity utilization and manufacturing and trade inventories. A few Federal Reserve officials are also slated to speak today.

Technically, August gold bulls and bears are on a level overall near-term technical playing field amid recent choppy trading. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at the June high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the June low of $2,304.20. First resistance is seen at the overnight high of $2,341.10 and then at $2,350.00. First support is seen at $2,315.00 and then at the June low of $2,304.20. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 5.0.

July silver futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage. However, prices are trending down on the daily bar chart. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at $31.00. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $28.00. First resistance is seen at today’s high of $29.76 and then at $30.00. Next support is seen at $29.00 and then at this week’s low of $28.73. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0.

21,"Jun 18, 2024","Gold prices catch a bid as U.S. retail sales increased 0.1% in May, missing expectations","(Kitco News) - The gold market has pushed into positive territory as the latest economic data shows U.S. consumers have started tightening their belts and adjusting their spending habits.
U.S. retail sales rose 0.1% last month following a downwardly revised drop of 0.2% in April, the U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday The data was significantly below expectations, as economists' consensus calls projected a 0.3% reading in May’s headline number.
Core sales, which exclude vehicle sales, fell 0.1% last month, also missing economist expectations for a 0.2% increase. April’s data was also revised lower, falling 0.1%.
Meanwhile, the report said that the control group, excluding sales from auto dealers, building-materials retailers, gas stations, office supply stores, which also feeds directly into U.S. GDP, increased 0.4%, in line with expectations. However, last month’s data was revised down, falling 0.5%, from the initial estimated decline of 0.3%.
The gold market was trading in slightly negative territory ahead of the data but has moved into the green in its initial reaction to the disappointing consumption numbers. August gold futures last traded at $2,334.an ounce, up 0.21% on the day.
Adam Button, head of commodity strategy at Forexlive.com said that the data is “undoubtedly negative for the US dollar and positive for bonds,” creating a positive environment for gold.
Analysts have said that slowing economic growth could force the Federal Reserve to cut rates sooner than expected, even if inflation remains stubbornly elevated. 
“With services consumption growth slowing in recent months and consumer confidence plummeting again, maybe households aren’t quite as impervious to higher interest rates as we were beginning to believe. Admittedly, we don’t expect a full-blown slump in consumption but, at the margin, even a modest slowdown in consumption growth (and consequently GDP growth too) could be enough to tip a finely balanced Fed in favour of a rate cut in September,” said Paul Ashworth, Chief North American Economist at Capital Economics."

23,"Jun 18, 2024",Why central banks are increasing their gold reserves: 29% plan to buy more in 2024 - World Gold Council report,"(Kitco News) - Central bank gold purchases continue to dominate and transform the gold market, and this trend is only getting stronger, according to the latest report from the World Gold Council.
On Tuesday, the WGC published the results of its annual Central Bank Gold Reserves survey. Of the 70 responses, 29% said they expect to increase their gold reserves in the next 12 months.

The WGC said this was the highest level it has seen since it started the annual survey in 2018.
“The planned purchases are chiefly motivated by a desire to rebalance to a more preferred strategic level of gold holdings, domestic gold production, and financial market concerns, including higher crisis risks and rising inflation,” the analysts said in the report.
The survey results come nearly two weeks after data from the People’s Bank of China showed that it didn’t increase its gold reserves in May, ending an 18-month buying spree. However, analysts have said that even if China slows its purchases, there is still robust interest in gold as a reserve diversified.
“While China has positively contributed to the level of annual demand from the official sector, we are still confident that central banks as a whole will remain net buyers. Buying has been broad-based, with several other central banks continuing to accumulate gold, even as the gold price has increased in recent months. As such, while central bank demand for 2024 may not reach the levels seen in 2022 or 2023, we still believe that it will remain healthy for the remainder of the year,” Krishan Gopaul, Senior Analyst at the World Gold Council, said in a recent comment to Kitco News before the survey data was released.
While nearly one-third of central banks surveyed look to buy gold this year, there is a broad-based expectation throughout the official sector that gold reserves will rise. The survey said that 81% of participants expect holdings to rise in the next 12 months, up sharply from 71% reported last year.
According to the survey, the growing diversification into gold comes as central banks see an increasing shift in global financial markets as the U.S. role as the world’s reserve currency continues to diminish.
Looking at the U.S. dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency, 62% of respondents said they think the dollar’s share will diminish five years from now, up from 55% in 2023 and 42% in 2022.
Meanwhile, regarding gold, 69% of respondents thought the yellow metal would constitute a larger proportion five years from now, up from 62% in 2023 and 46% in 2022.
The World Gold Council noted that sentiment is significantly different when broken down between central banks in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDE) and those in developed nations. EMDE central banks generally see gold’s role as a monetary metal increasing as the U.S. dollar’s shine tarnishes.
However, while advanced economy central banks remain loyal to the greenback, they admit that gold’s role in the global landscape is changing.
“EMDE central banks, which have been the primary driver of gold buying since the 2008 global financial crisis, appear to be more pessimistic about the US dollar’s future share of global reserves and more optimistic about that of gold,” the analysts said in the report. “Nonetheless, it is notable too that the percentage of advanced economy respondents who believe that gold’s share of global reserves will rise has increased significantly from 38% in 2023 to 57% in 2024.”
As central banks look to diversify away from the U.S. dollar, the participants said that “interest rate levels,” “inflation concerns,” and “geopolitical instability” continue to be the leading factors in central bankers’ reserve management decisions, relatively in line with the responses last year.
According to the survey, central banks are motivated to hold gold because it is seen as a “long-term store of value/inflation hedge,” its “performance during times of crisis,” an “effective portfolio diversifier,” and there is “no default risk.”

“These results seem to reflect an underlying theme of EMDE central banks, but also increasingly advanced economy central banks, valuing gold’s strategic role amidst uncertain geopolitical times and renewed concerns about financial stability. This underscores the challenging economic and strategic circumstances faced by both groups,” the analysts said. "
24,"Jun 17, 2024","Bank of America remains bullish on silver, sees $35 an ounce by 2026","
(Kitco News) - Although market volatility has knocked silver down a peg with prices trading below $30 an ounce, a growing chorus of analysts is not ready to give up on the precious metal just yet.
Bank of America is the latest institution to weigh in on the market, seeing robust potential in the mining sector. Despite the recent selloff in silver, Michael Widmer, the bank’s precious metals strategist, expects silver prices to push to $35 an ounce within the next two years.
In the short term, many analysts note that even in the current correction, silver has managed to hold solid support at its upward-trending 50-day moving average. July silver futures last traded at $29.235 an ounce, down 0.86% on the day.
In the last couple of years, gold has been the go-to safe-haven asset as investors looked to hedge against geopolitical risks; however, Bank of America expects that now it’s silver's time to shine as it has just recently started to perform within the precious metals sector.
“Silver has underperformed gold as industrial demand has been weak. With the global economy turning a corner, the white metal should start to perform better. Additional support is also coming through as the next generation of solar panels, which are more silver-intensive, are gaining traction. All of this may then also attract more investors to the market, creating a virtuous cycle that pushes prices higher, with $30/oz within reach,” Lawson Winder, Research Analyst at BofA and the lead author of the latest silver report, said.
In this environment, Winder affirmed the bank’s buy-rating for silver equities. The bank’s two big silver picks are Pan American Silver (NYSE: PAAS) and Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE: WPM).
“PAAS is catalyst-rich, has a solid balance sheet, and offers solid production growth with significant upside potential across various assets in the portfolio,” Winder said. “WPM has peer-leading volume growth, is exposed to top-tier jurisdictions, has a strong balance sheet, and offers insulation from industry inflationary cost pressures.”
Although silver has significant potential as an industrial metal, Winder said that for prices to take off, investment demand has to pick up.
“While prices have been maintained, we acknowledge that silver has not made a decisive push higher of late. Why not? Lackluster investor demand is one reason. We are seeing a lack of interest among assets under management at physically backed ETFs. This is also reflected in CME net non-commercial positions, trading volumes on the Shanghai Gold Exchange/Shanghai Futures Exchange, and US coin purchases. Yet, we also note encouraging signs in commercial demand, which may ultimately attract investors, reinforcing our constructive view on the metal for 2024,” Widmer said in the note."

26,"Jun 17, 2024","Gold price holds up in the face of Fed hawkishness, silver tests key support as coin sales diverge – Heraeus","(Kitco News) – Gold prices have fared fairly well in the wake of the Fed’s hawkish rhetoric and rate projections, while silver’s coin demand is seeing a significant divergence between major producers as spot prices test support, according to precious metals strategists at Heraeus.
In their latest precious metals report, the analysts noted that gold prices have made gains despite the Federal Reserve’s renewed hawkishness.
“On 12 June, the US reported a relatively flat headline CPI – a 3.3% year-on-year increase and unchanged on a seasonally adjusted basis – the lowest numbers in three years,” they noted. “This provided some support for the gold price, although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s subsequent signalling of cautiousness on rate-cutting after a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting made it temporary.”
“Currently, members of the FOMC remain divided on whether to support one or two rate cuts this year,” they said, adding that the swap market is still pricing in a 42% chance that the Fed will deliver 50 basis points of rate cuts in 2024. “The gold price is still consolidating its gains, with support around $2,280/oz holding,” they said.
The analysts also noted that extreme weather events have disrupted first-quarter gold production in Australia. “Cyclones and heavy rain that led to floods resulted in a drop in gold output in Australia to 70 t in Q1’24 from 77 t in Q4’23,” they wrote. “In 2023, Australia was the world’s second-largest gold producer (310 t), second only to China (source: Statista). However, buoyed by high prices, most miners are maintaining production forecasts for the year.”
Gold is seeing a subdued start to the week, with spot gold opening at $2,334.87 per ounce in the overnight session before dropping to a daily low of $2,315.54 around 3 am EDT. It has since recovered somewhat, last trading at $2,324.71 per ounce for a loss of 0.34% on the day.

Turning to silver, the analysts said that after dropping below $30 per ounce following the June 7 Fed meeting, the gray metal’s spot price oscillated between $29 and $30 last week, testing key support.
“The gold:silver ratio rebounded to 79 from early June’s low of 73 as silver has underperformed gold, with both metals’ prices falling,” they noted.

On the physical demand side, Heraeus highlighted the significant divergence between the Perth and US Mint’s silver coin sales this year.
“Perth Mint silver coin sales remained weak, as the May sales of 796,934 oz significantly trailed previous years,” they noted. “May sales data represented a 58% decrease year-on-year and the lowest May figure in five years. Year-to-date sales reached 4.12 moz, a 51% drop year-on-year.”
They said that the weakness of Perth Mint silver coin sales in 2024 suggests that higher metal prices have impacted consumer demand.
“The US Mint sales, in contrast, appeared much more robust than in previous years,” they wrote. “During May, sales of 1.75 moz were recorded, a 9.7% year-on-year rise. Year-to-date sales reached 12.6 moz, a 52% increase year-on-year.”

Silver prices followed gold lower in early trading on Monday and tested key support at $29.026 per ounce just before 3 am EDT. The gray metal has since staged a modest recovery but remains in negative territory on the session, last trading at $29.468 for a loss of 0.30% on the daily chart.

On Monday, the regional central bank said its Empire State Manufacturing Survey rose to -6, up from May’s reading of -15.6. Although activity remains in contraction territory, the survey was better than expected, as economists were looking for a reading of around -12.5.
“Manufacturing conditions remained weak in New York State in June. Employment continued contracting, and capital spending plans remained flat. Despite lackluster conditions, optimism about the six-month outlook rose to its highest level in over two years.” said Richard Deitz, Economic Research Advisor at the New York Fed in the report.
The latest economic data is not significantly impacting gold’s price action. August gold futures last traded at $2,333.30 an opulence, down 0.67% on the day.
Analysts have said that gold needs to see a solid push above $2,350 an ounce before the market’s neutral sentiment starts to shift.
Although activity remains weak, the report noted broad-based improvement. The New Orders Index rose to -1.0, up sharply from May’s reading at -16.5; meanwhile, the Shipments Index rose to 3.3 up from -1.2.
However, the labor market continues to lose momentum. The report said the Number of Employees Index dropped to -8.7, down from May’s reading of -6.4.
The report also noted that the slower economic activity is also helping cool down inflation. The report said that the Prices Index dropped to 24.5, down from the prior reading of 28.3. "

30,"Jun 14, 2024",The world is going to need more gold,"(Kitco News) - Last week, we warned investors that gold’s selloff was an overreaction to misunderstood fundamental news.
Blackbox (algorithmic trading) gold traders, who have been relying on Chinese central bank buying, were spooked when data from the People’s Bank of China showed that it didn’t increase its reserves last month, ending an 18-month shopping spree.
Gold managed to hold critical support at $2,300 on Monday and is seeing a 1% gain on the week heading into the weekend.
Given all the geopolitical uncertainty around the world, it is ludicrous to think that China is done buying gold.
This week, I attended the 30th annual Montreal Conference of the International Economic Forum of the Americas, which helped me better understand the growing trend of deglobalization.
“It’s extraordinary to me to see how rapidly we've moved from a situation where globalization seemed inevitable to where today it increasingly seems impossible,” said Perrin Beatty, a former Progressive Conservative Cabinet Minister and President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, during a panel discussion.
While the U.S. dollar is expected to remain the world’s reserve currency, it will face growing competition. 
Analysts constantly reiterate that gold will play a growing role in a multipolar currency world because it remains one of the most liquid monetary assets in global financial markets.
We can already see the U.S. dollar’s diminished role on the world stage. This week, the trade agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which established the petrodollar, was allowed to expire.
For the past 50 years, the U.S. dollar has dominated global trade as the two nations agreed to price oil in U.S. dollars. This agreement cemented the dollar as the world’s reserve currency and ushered in an era of prosperity for 
Americans; in exchange, the U.S. provided military support and protection to the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia’s moves to expand beyond the USD come as it enters a new trading bloc with expanded BRICS nations: Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.
During the Montreal conference, Ali Borhani, Managing Director of 3Sixty Strategic Advisors Ltd and co-founder and host of the BRI Dialogues, put the expanded trading bloc into perspective and noted that people have to recognize that the world has changed.
“Half of the world population is in BRICS+. Two-thirds of world trade happens in BRICS+. BRICS are adding 74 million consumers a year. That is two times Canada out of these markets,” Borhani said during the panel discussion. 
“The largest buyers of energy and the largest sellers of energy happen to be in the Global South and among BRICS. So we're looking at the rewiring of energy, finance, supply chain, and tech.”
Because of these broad-reaching geopolitical shifts, it is fairly easy to make a simple case for gold as a global currency. Many analysts have noted that gold remains the best neutral asset to settle trade imbalances.
So it's not just China that is going to have to buy more gold; nations around the world, especially those in emerging markets that have relied so heavily on the U.S. dollar, will have to rebuild their gold reserves.
That is it for this week. Have a great weekend."
31,"Jun 14, 2024",Gold looks good again next week as both Wall Street and Main Street turn bullish,"
(Kitco News) – After last week's price action was dominated by Friday’s news from China and the employment report, precious metals markets were squarely focused on inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate path this week. 
After kicking off the week trading at $2,293.70 per ounce during the Sunday evening Asian session, spot gold broke above the $2,300 level about two hours before the North American market open, and that level held throughout the rest of the week's roller coaster ride. 
Gold prices chopped along in a relatively narrow $15 channel as market participants waited for Wednesday, which would bring the consumer inflation report in the morning, then the FOMC rate announcement, updated economic projections, and Chair Powell's press conference in the afternoon. 
The CPI report finally shook the market out of its sideways trading, spiking spot gold from $2,313 per ounce just before the data release to its weekly high of $2,336.72 immediately afterward. By the time the Federal Reserve announced that they were keeping rates unchanged at 2:00 p.m., the price had pulled back to $2,326 per ounce, and spot gold continued to sell off steadily as markets digested Powell’s hawkish rhetoric and the FOMC's updated projection of only one rate cut in all of 2024.
By Thursday, spot gold had once again slid back down to support, but it saw a firm bounce just below the $2,300 level and by Friday morning the yellow metal was once again marching higher into the weekend. 

The latest Kitco News Weekly Gold Survey has a majority of industry experts and retail traders seeing green for gold prices next week as they emerge from their bearish hibernation and return to bullish pastures.
“Gold snapped a three-week decline, encouraged by political uncertainty in Europe, and a sharp drop in interest rates,” said Marc Chandler, Managing Director at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It recovered about half of what it lost after the US jobs data on June 7 and on reports that the PBOC did not buy gold for reserves last month.”
Chandler noted that spot gold traded to around $2841 in the middle of last week before consolidating. “Gold was relatively restrained, perhaps pulled by conflicting signals—of a stronger dollar on the one hand, and lower rates on the other. Trendline resistance begins the new week near $2362. On a medium-term view, I suspect gold is nearer a bottom than a top and expected lower interest rates to underpin the yellow metal.”
“I’m sticking with ‘up’ for this week as bulls put in a strong defense of $2300,” said James Stanley, senior market strategist at Forex.com. “The pullbacks are getting more concerning, however, as that shows bulls taking advantage of strength to realize profits and square up positions. That’s helped to build a possible head and shoulders pattern. That formation requires a breach of the neckline, but if it does then I think we could be soon looking at a deeper pullback scenario. And for that, I’m tracking the longer-term range resistance, around the $2,075-$2,082 level for longer-term support to play in.”
“For now, support remains in play and I’m biasing bullish, but I’m ready to change if the neckline breaks,” Stanley said.
“Up,” said Adrian Day, President of Adrian Day Asset Management. “Gold is recovering from last week’s sell-off as U.S. economic news has been more ‘dovish’ – weaker producer inflation numbers and higher claims for unemployment – both helping the case for a cut in interest rates, and geopolitical tensions heighten – more attacks on Israel from Hezbollah and Russian warships in the Caribbean.”
“I am bullish on Gold for next week,” said Colin Cieszynski, Chief Market Strategist at SIA Wealth Management. “It’s looking ready for a technical bounce up off of support.”
Sean Lusk, co-director of commercial hedging at Walsh Trading, was reflecting on what traders had learned from both last week and this one.
“I think this recent drop is just a reflection of two things in gold,” Lusk said. “Obviously, last week China just shot an arrow across the bow when nobody was looking, that they were backing off some gold purchases. They said that stuff so they can buy it cheaper, that’s how I view that. And China can say whatever the hell they want, but they have to back up all their money printing.”
“We also had what was deemed to be a blowout unemployment report by some media outlets,” he said. “What a laughable joke that was; not a blowout employment report, it wasn't even close to that. A lot of the gains were government-created, not in the private sector, and if you look within the numbers, and the revisions lower the prior two months, it wasn't that much of a gain, if any.”
Lusk said last Friday’s sharp correction downward wasn’t justified based on those releases. “But the market's going to do what it's going to do, and sometimes you can't fight it,” he said.
“Then CPI came in [this week], hit the dollar one day, and then they brought it back up on PPI,” Lusk observed. “It's just a mixed bag of nonsense, really. But I think for gold's price here, it's a pure consolidation. We held the weekly low down at $2,304. There's a lot of uncertainty all over the place, and I think that the path of least resistance for metals is still higher.”
Lusk said that since last Friday, the August futures contract dropped from $2,406 all the way to $2,304. “You dropped $100 in a day,” he noted. “That's pretty steep, right? But you haven't revisited that low. So now the key resistance is going to be that big ‘drop day’ high. You can draw a trend line from the May high the week before Memorial Day weekend at $2,477 to $2,406. Wherever that line's coming in, that's your trend line that you’ve got to watch. If they blow through last Friday morning's high before China made that announcement, then we're going up to $2,485, if not $2,500.”
“Now, should we blow through $2,304, then we're going down to $2,280 and we might go down to $2,200,” he cautioned. “But I think the trend is still up overall, no doubt about that. You've come off the highs a little bit, but you've had a hell of a run since the February lows. From $1,996 you ran up to $2,454 on the continuous. That’s a $458 move in three months.”
This week, 13 Wall Street analysts participated in the Kitco News Gold Survey, and after this week’s performance, they were considerably more optimistic about the precious metal’s near-term prospects. Eight experts, representing 62%, expect to see gold prices climb higher next week, while only two analysts, or 15%, predicted a price decline. The remaining three, or 23% of the total, expect gold to trade sideways during the coming week.
Meanwhile, 216 votes were cast in Kitco’s online poll, with Main Street investors somewhat more cautious than their institutional counterparts, but positive on balance. 117 retail traders, or 54%, look for gold prices to rise next week. Another 49, or 23%, expected the yellow metal to trade lower, while 50 respondents, representing the remaining 23%, saw prices chopping sideways during the week ahead.

With the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision in the books, markets will shift their focus to Europe next week as the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of England will both announce their monetary policy decisions on Thursday morning.
Markets will also receive the Empire State manufacturing index on Monday, and retail sales for May on Tuesday. Then, Thursday brings housing starts and building permits for May, as well as weekly jobless claims and the Philly Fed manufacturing index. The week’s data wraps up with existing home sales on Friday morning.
Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst at Barchart.com, expects gold to build on this week’s rebound and make further gains. “While August gold’s intermediate-term trend remains down, its short-term trend has turned up,” he said. “This means the contract should take out its previous high of $2,358.80 with the next upside target near $2,370, then $2,391.”
“As we head into the weekend, I’m looking for increased investment buying tied to the political chaos in France,” Newsom added. “We can’t call it a Black Swan event given it was predictable as the China/Russia coalition gets more desperate ahead of the global 2024 election cycle.”
Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said he thinks gold’s support at $2,300 looks extremely fragile and unreliable.
“Firstly, last Friday, Gold went over 4% from peak to bottom, on high volumes and with a horrendous amplitude falling under the 50-day moving average,” he said. “All other dynamics of this week may well be considered as consolidation of liquidity by bears for a new blow to the metal. This thesis is reinforced by the fact that this 50-day average is already actively working as resistance.”
“Secondly, the dollar has been rising since last Friday, as if switching into a ‘buy on the downturn’ mode,” Kuptsikevich said. “The dollar index has pushed back from its 200-day moving average since the beginning of the month. And a rising dollar with attractive bond interest yields makes dollar bonds an effective competitor to gold.”
The third factor weighing on gold is the ongoing slide in stocks. “Separate from the short-squeeze-backed gains in individual stocks in the Nasdaq100 and S&P500, there is noticeable heaviness in the Dow Jones and Russell 2000 indices, not to mention the 5% loss by the French CAC40 for the week,” he said. “Politics was back to spooking the markets as we heard of new barrages of trade wars and the risks of increased protectionism.”
Adam Button, head of currency strategy at Forexlive.com, was also reflecting on the shifting political landscape and its short- and long-term implications for precious metals and the dollar.
“The consensus around open borders and open trade was built with the U.S. dollar at the heart of it,” Button said. “Breaking that system will have impacts, and we're seeing them, on the U.S. dollar, especially now that the U.S. is wielding tariffs as a tool. Trump the other day was talking about replacing income tax with tariffs. That's an attack on even a country like Canada, potentially. I don't think it's realistic, but 10 years from now, who knows? And what does 2028 look like? Does it look like two reasonable human beings in an election fight?”
“That's the way the pendulum is swinging,” he added. “And if it is, what are you doing holding Treasuries? When they say you're cheating on your tariffs, or you're cheating on imports, and they decide to steal your money, like they did to Russia?
“That seems outlandish, but in a world like that, what's gold worth?” Button asked. “$10,000? $20,000?”
Turning to Europe, Button said that the Franco-German consensus that has governed Europe since the dawn of the euro is ending. “What happens to the Eurozone from here? And the EU, what's the point of the whole thing if that's broken?” he asked. “We're seeing that in French bonds right now. It's not hard to envision the next German election, the next Hungarian election again, even the Dutch swung that way.”
“Political turmoil is the theme right now,” he said. “And that's a classic gold driver.”
That said, Button still doesn’t expect gold to rise in the near term. “Do I want to be long gold next week? No, I don't,” he said. “If something can't rally on good news, then it's not going to rally. That was the best CPI report that gold bulls could have hoped for, and gold didn't rally. It's having a decent day today, but maybe that's the push and pull of the political side.”
“I don't like the price action this week, that's what it comes down to for me,” Button added. “If $2,300 breaks, what's the downside? Probably like $2,150, something like that. Maybe I'm interested there.”
The other thing he’d like to see is whether gold prices can withstand some real pain in equities. 
“No one has forgotten how poorly gold did at the outset of COVID,” Button said. “And I'm not to say that we'll see equities puke like that, but it hasn't been a counter-cyclical trade. So I just want to see what gold looks like in a poor day for equities, a real poor day, which I think we're headed toward. We just need one bad NVIDIA headline. It's really carrying the whole market here.”
Michael Moor, Founder of Moor Analytics, was breaking down the technical picture from gold’s recent price action in the lower and higher timeframes.
“On a lower timeframe basis: The trade below 24343 (+1.3 tics per/hour) has brought in $130.1 of pressure,” Moor wrote. “The trade below 24216 (+4 tics per/hour) projects this downward $60 (+)—we have attained $117.4.  These rolled from (M) into the (Q).  The trade back below 23642 (-1.2 tics per/hour) in (Q) has brought in $60.0 of pressure.   Decent trade above 23489 (-1.2 tics per/hour starting at 7:00am) should bring in decent strength.”
“Areas of possible exhaustion to contend with below come in at 65216-4785, 62926, and 60280-59628; and we have entered into the ideal timeframe for one of these to hold more than temporarily - if we settle below the lower of these, this should be a larger, higher timeframe correction,” he said.
And Kitco Senior Analyst Jim Wyckoff holds a balanced view toward gold going into next week. “Choppy and sideways as bulls and bears are on a neutral near-term technical playing field,” he said.
Spot gold last traded at $2333.21 at the time of writing, up 1.26% on the day and 1.71% on the week.

32,"Jun 14, 2024",Gold price risks rise as head and shoulder pattern emerges,"
(Kitco News) - A new divergence between the Federal Reserve’s interest rate forecast and market expectations could create some volatility in the gold market in the near term. However, some analysts note that as the precious metal continues to consolidate, it will be more important to watch technical levels.
James Stanley, Senior Market Strategist at Forex.com, said that the fundamental outlook, dominated by geopolitical uncertainty and rising debt levels, remains supportive for gold. However, he added that the short-term technical outlook is a little more precarious, as the price action is forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern with a neckline support zone between $2,300 and $2,275.
“The neckline hasn’t broken yet. It’s been close but no cigar,” he said. “As long as the $2,300 area remains defended, I’m still bullish. I don't want to take a bearish stance on gold until we have that head and shoulders starting to fill in.”
Stanley’s cautious outlook comes as gold prices look to close the week with solid gains. August gold futures last traded at $2,349.50 an ounce, up 1% from last Friday’s close.
Stanley added that if gold breaks below his initial support levels, he would not be surprised to see prices fall all the way to $2,100 and retest critical support at $2,075, which was roughly a three-year resistance line prior to this year’s breakout.
Alex Kuptsikevich, Senior Market Analyst at FxPro, said that although gold has managed to hold support at $2,300 in its last two tests, this level is looking a little fragile. He noted that a combination of weak equity markets and a strong U.S. dollar could create some headwinds for the precious metal in the near term.
“In 2008, 2011, and 2020, the initial rise in the value of an ounce against a background of falling stocks and a rising dollar quickly reversed into a collapse in the gold price,” he said. “It is worth keeping a close eye on how events in the currency and stock market unfold. And if the risk-off continues, buying gold will be as dangerous as picking up pennies in front of a train.”
Although gold’s downside risk is growing, Stanley said that he expects a drop will create long-term value in the market.
“If I’m looking at gold a few years down the road, I am pretty sure that prices are going higher as the government continues to spend money and take on more debt,” he said. “A deeper pullback will create a long-term buying opportunity.”
However, other analysts are expecting gold to continue to shine as selling pressure in the equity market is due to geopolitical uncertainty. France’s snap election, called at the start of the week following the European Union elections, has roiled markets.
Investors fleeing French equities and bonds have pushed the spread between French and German 10-year yields to nearly 70 basis points, its widest level in seven years.
Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, said that this uncertainty is one reason why gold has held up against renewed momentum in the U.S. dollar.
“U.S. dollar strength, which normally should weigh on precious metal prices, has so far not materialized. The reason being the strength is driven by euro weakness after the French president shocked investors by calling a snap vote after his party suffered a crushing defeat in European parliamentary elections,” he said. “The market fears a repeat defeat to the far-right party could trigger a debt crisis, potentially adding support to gold from worried investors.”
Hansen said that he also expects gold to be well-supported as central banks remain stoic buyers, even after data from the People’s Bank of China showed it didn’t add any gold to its reserves last month.
“China, a major driver of the gold rally in the past year, is in our opinion nowhere near done buying gold, but the pause also highlights they are human, balking at the prospect of paying record prices. Also, the recent attention paid to Chinese private buying has likely thrust them into a spotlight they normally avoid,” he said.
Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst at City Index and founder of TradingCandles.com, said he sees gold’s rebound from last week’s selloff as a solid sign of strength as it continues to consolidate. He noted that there was no follow-through selling from last week, which saw the biggest drop in two years.
“A potential rally could be on the horizon now that the Fed meeting and CPI data are both out of the way. The bulls have pushed gold above short-term resistance at $2,330. Now an ideal scenario would be to push it past the short-term bearish trend line around $2,360,” he said. “However, the short-term XAUUSD forecast will become slightly bearish if there is another daily close below $2,300 in the week ahead, which could lead to further short-term selling toward the next support level at $2,222.”
The growing focus on gold’s technical price action comes ahead of a fairly light week for economic data.
Markets will receive some regional and preliminary manufacturing data and some housing data.
With the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision wrapped up, markets will turn their attention to Europe as the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of England will announce their monetary policy decisions next week.
The SNB was the first central bank to kick off the global easing cycle as it lowered interest rates at its previous meeting. Economists are expecting to see another cut.
In England, the BoE is expected to keep rates unchanged at 5.25%. However, analysts have said that they expect the central bank will start to lay the groundwork for an August cut.
Although the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to embark on an easing cycle as inflation remains elevated, many analysts have said that falling interest rates worldwide remain supportive for gold in the global context."
33,"Jun 14, 2024","Gold - the new reserve asset: Price target of $7k-$15k by 2030 is just a return to the ‘long-term average,’ Bitcoin at $420k? Luke Gromen","(Kitco News) - U.S. Treasuries will be dumped as global reserves by 2030 as the U.S. dollar gets re-priced from ""widely overvalued"" levels, triggering 3X returns in gold and 6X returns in Bitcoin, according to Luke Gromen, founder and president of Forest for the Trees (FFTT).
Gromen told Michelle Makori, lead anchor and editor-in-chief at Kitco News, that the economic policies of the past 40 years are intentionally being ""trashed"" in the U.S., which will have a massive impact on everything from U.S. Treasuries and the dollar to gold and Bitcoin.

Over the last few decades, the U.S. has become good at exporting Treasury bonds and bad at exporting everything else. This is what is changing right now, Gromen notes. 
""What Janet Yellen's telling you, what Jake Sullivan [National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan] is telling you, what the Department of Defense is telling you is that it's a national security interest to get out of the Treasury export business and to get into the stuff export business again,"" Gromen said. ""But we can't do that without a much weaker dollar, and the arbiter of that is going to be the price of gold. You're seeing U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen throw 40 years of economic orthodoxy in the trash."" 
This shift from Yellen, whose purview is the dollar, is significant. ""This is about as big as when [former President Richard] Nixon closed the gold window,"" Gromen described. In the future, ""the 130 trillion bond market is the sucker at the cards table.""
Gromen explains that the dollar system as we know it is dying, with the the U.S. treasury bond losing its position as the world's primary reserve asset. This is why the greenback will get re-priced. However, Gromen rules out that the USD will get replaced, stating that it will remain the global reserve currency. 
Watch the video above to find out why the U.S. dollar will be re-priced and not replaced as the global reserve currency and according to what. 
The new global reserve asset
The U.S. Treasury market has been losing its share as a primary global reserve asset since 2014 because global central banks have sold $400 billion worth of Treasuries on the net and bought $600 billion worth of gold on the net.
""Global central banks stopped buying U. S. Treasury bonds ten years ago on a net basis, and U.S. debt has not stopped growing,"" Gromen said. ""There's a widening gap between the supply of U.S. Treasury bonds and demand from global central banks.""
For Gromen's reason why this has been happening, watch the video above. 
Gold has been seeing solid gains this year, up 12.5% year-to-date, after hitting multiple new record highs, and it will keep rising towards 2030, Gromen noted. 
""Every single thing in macro is telling you it will keep going higher. You're seeing the BRICS go into gold. You're seeing Yellen throw 40 years of economic orthodoxy in the trash. You're seeing the Fed say we won't let Treasury market dysfunction happen by adding liquidity when it is needed,"" he said. 
The alternative to the Treasuries as the global reserve asset is gold. ""Treasuries for central banks are no longer risk-free instruments. If you do something the United States government doesn't like, they will take the Treasuries—full stop. They've done it to Russia and others, which has opened eyes,"" Gromen said.  
Gromen added that nobody trusts the Chinese yuan when it comes to finding another reserve option, and even if they did, China doesn't want to open its capital account and issue debt.
""Gold is doing what it's doing because gold is taking the place of Treasury bonds as a primary reserve asset globally at the central bank level. And as that happens, that's a lot of buying against a gold market whose annual production is $240 billion,"" he explained. 
Gold price forecast 
The markets are sensing this shift away from Treasuries, increasing gold prices. 
""Markets are reflexively beginning to understand that Treasury market dysfunction will not be allowed on a sustained basis, in which case you've got a 130 trillion dollar global bond market increasingly squeezing into the 65 trillion dollar U.S dollar equity market, roughly 14 trillion dollar gold market and the 1.4 trillion dollar Bitcoin market,"" Gromen said. 
This is why there have been spikes in S&P 500, Nasdaq, gold, and Bitcoin charts over the long bond. ""All of this has happened in the last 18 to 24 months. Those are the signs of the bond market recognizing that, on a real basis, it is the sucker at the card table. The bubble is in the long-term U.S. Treasury bonds,"" Gromen noted. 
To put gold's upcoming multi-year rally into perspective, Gromen said that gold's move higher has barely begun. ""To reflect a reversion to the mean of being the primary reserve asset, it needs to be orders of magnitude higher in price,"" he said. 
To get a more precise outlook, Gromen looks at the market value of U.S. official gold relative to foreign-held treasuries outstanding. 
""In 1989, when the USSR fell, that percentage was 20%. When we had a dollar crisis in 1979 and 1980, the percentage was 134%. Fast forward to today, this ratio is at 7%. So gold would need to triple just to get back to the very bottom of the long of this range where we were in 1989, the last time we had a great power competition,"" he estimated. 
This is Gromen's conservative outlook; for his other price scenarios, watch the video above. 
What it all means for Bitcoin
Bitcoin also plays a key role in this new reserve asset environment. 
""Bitcoin is an energy-linked neutral reserve asset for the people. It is a digital gold-like instrument in that way. More dollar liquidity means a weaker dollar, and that's good for Bitcoin,"" Gromen said. ""It does a lot of things that gold does arguably better than gold. But again, it has a lot more volatility, and it is a much smaller market.""
Gromen is not ruling out 6X returns for Bitcoin in the next six years as investors sell bonds and buy assets that hold value. ""Something that holds value is U.S. stocks, gold, and Bitcoin.""
In this scenario, Bitcoin would outperform gold due to higher volatility. ""If gold goes up 3X, I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin goes up 6X. They can both win,"" he said.

34,"Jun 14, 2024","Chinese physical gold demand slid across the board in May, but ETFs remained strong – World Gold Council","
(Kitco News) – Chinese physical gold demand was weaker across the board in May amid high local prices, but local ETFs continued their recent string of inflows, according to Ray Jia, China Research Head at the World Gold Council.
“Gold extended its strength in May albeit with a narrower increase than in recent months,” Jia wrote in the latest WGC China update. “Both the LBMA Gold Price AM in USD and the SHAUPM in RMB rose by 1% last month.”

Jia said that U.S. dollar weakness, lower bond yields, and rising demand from gold ETFs contributed to gold’s price strength during the month, but early June saw the LBMA Gold Price AM fall by 2% while the SHAUPM in RMB saw a further 1% rise due to a weakening yuan. 
“During the first five months of 2024, gold in RMB has surged by more than 15%, outperforming all major assets in China,” he noted. “Robust demand, geopolitical risk spikes, RMB weakness, and the prospect of a global easing cycle ahead, were the main drivers of gold’s strength.”

Physical demand for the yellow metal cooled significantly last month, posting its weakest May in four years.
“Gold withdrawals from the SGE amounted to 82t in May, 49t lower m/m and 30t lower y/y,” Jia said. “[T]he elevated gold price dimmed consumer interest in gold jewellery, leading to weaker-than-expected sales during the five-day International Labour Day Holiday in early May – a traditional demand boost – and this trend continued for the rest of the month.”
He added that the moderation in gold prices also discouraged physical bar and coin investors to the sidelines.
“Consequently, wholesale gold demand experienced its weakest May since 2020 – when demand was affected by the COVID pandemic – ending the month 34% below the 10-year average,” Jia said. “Nonetheless, due to demand strength earlier this year, gold withdrawals have totalled 736t so far in 2024, 35t higher y/y.”

Jia said that activity in China’s gold futures market also pulled back considerably in May. “Following the surge in April, trading volumes of Shanghai Futures Exchange’s active gold future contract cooled – averaging 193t per day in May, a 44% m/m fall,” he wrote. “However, volumes remain well above the five-year average of 163t.”

The premium local buyers paid over global spot prices also fell last month. “On average, the Chinese gold price premium fell to US$32/oz in May, US$10/oz lower m/m,” Jia said. The m/m drop was mainly driven by weakening wholesale demand.”

But despite all the other price and demand indicators sliding, the country’s gold ETFs still saw continued inflows in May.
“Chinese gold ETFs added RMB1.8bn (US$253mn) in May, the sixth consecutive monthly inflow,” Jia noted. “May pushed the total AUM to RMB48bn (US$6.7bn), another record high, and collective holdings increased by 3t to 87t, also the highest ever.”

Jia said that declining equities, yuan weakness, and a slide in Chinese government bond yields combined to push investors into gold.
“Interestingly, we noticed accelerating inflows towards the end of the month when the gold price corrected, showing signs of ‘dip buying’, which had been the main pattern prior to 2020,” he said. “Chinese funds have attracted RMB14bn (US$2bn) y-t-d, pushing total AUM and holdings 41% and 65% higher, respectively.”
Of course, the big news from last Friday was the announcement that the gold reserves of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) remained unchanged in May, bringing its 18-month buying streak to an end.
“The PBoC’s gold reserves stood at 2,264t at the end of May; the first month in which there has been no announcement of gold buying since November 2022,” Jia wrote. “Gold now accounts for 4.93% of China’s total official reserves, the highest ever thanks to May’s gold price strength. The PBOC stated gold reserve increase remains at 29t y-t-d, representing a 1.3% rise in holdings during the same period.”

Imports were also marginally lower in April, the WGC noted, with consumers electing to remain on the sidelines as local gold prices hovered close to record highs.
“Gold imports into China totalled 77t in April, 8t lower m/m and a 24t fall y/y,” Jia said. “We believe this was mainly a result of weaker gold jewellery demand during the month.”

“Nonetheless, imports held up relatively well during past months when the gold price surged – investment demand strength has partially cancelled out gold jewellery consumption slowdown,” he said.
Looking ahead, Jia said that high prices “may continue to suppress gold jewellery consumption and further divert consumers to lighter and cheaper products,” and added that they “don’t expect wholesale demand to pick up until mid-to-late Q3, when manufacturers and retailers replenish for the National Day Holiday sales boost.”
Regarding the pullback in bar and coin sales he said the WGC believes that “heightened geopolitical risks, as well as the fact that gold has been a strong-performing non-RMB and global asset, should continue to attract investors” but in the near term, “investment demand for gold may be negatively impacted by the recent price correction – which may push undecided investors to the sidelines.”"
35,"Jun 14, 2024","Gold price up, but sees little new momentum as UofM consumer sentiment drops to 65.6","(Kitco News) - The gold market is holding on to solid gains ahead of the weekend but is not seeing any significant reaction as U.S. consumer sentiment continues to drop and inflation expectations remain elevated.
Friday, the University of Michigan said the preliminary reading of its Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 65.6 compared to May’s revised reading of 69.1. The data was weaker than expected, as consensus forecasts called for a reading of around 72.1.
The gold market continues to see stick resistance at $2,350 an ounce in its initial reaction to the latest sentiment numbers. August gold futures last traded at $2,347 an ounce, up more than 1.25% on the day.
Although the data was weaker than expected, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu dismissed the decline saying sentiment is little changed from May.
“this month’s reading was a statistically insignificant 3.5 index points below May and within the margin of error. Sentiment is currently about 31% above the trough seen in June 2022 amid the escalation in inflation,” she said. “Overall, consumers perceive few changes in the economy from May.”
Although one-year inflation expectations were unchanged at 3.3%, the report noted broad-based expectations for inflation to remain stubbornly elevated for the foreseeable future.
Hsu noted that the one-year inflation expectations remain above the two-year range seen before the pandemic.
“Long-run inflation expectations have been remarkably stable over the last three years but remain elevated relative to the 2.2-2.6% range seen in the two years pre-pandemic,” she said.  "
36,"Jun 14, 2024",Good price gains for gold as U.S. bond yields dip  ,"(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are higher, with gold posting soild gains, in early U.S. trading Friday. A dip in U.S. Treasury yields late this week is friendly for the two precious metals markets. Gold and silver traders may be thinking about the old trading adage: “The bond market traders are the smartest guys/gals in the room.” If that’s actually the case, then it can be extrapolated that the late-week dip in U.S. Treasury yields suggests the bond traders believe the Federal Reserve will ease its monetary policy later this year, with at least one interest rate cut, if not two. This notion comes despite the more-hawkish-than-expected FOMC meeting this week. August gold was last up $30.20 at $2,348.00. July silver was last up $0.269 at $29.335.
Asian and European stock indexes were mixed overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward lower openings when the New York day session begins. It’s a quieter end Friday to what was a very busy trading week for the marketplace.
In overnight news, the Bank of Japan said it will reduce its government bond purchases in a signal of monetary policy tightening, but left its main interest rate unchanged. Still, the Japanese yen weakened against the U.S. dollar due to little specifics offered by the BOJ regarding future monetary policy moves.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index higher and hit a six-week high overnight. Nymex crude oil prices are near steady and trading around $78.75 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently 4.25%.
U.S. economic data due for release Friday includes import and export prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey.

Technically, August gold bulls and bears are on a level overall near-term technical playing field amid recent choppy trading. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at the June high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the June low of $2,304.20. First resistance is seen at this week’s high of $2,358.80 and then at $2,375.00. First support is seen at $2,330.00 and then at the overnight low of $2,316.70. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 5.0.

July silver futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage. However, prices are trending down on the daily bar chart.

Although the PBOC didn’t announce any increase in its gold reserves last month, it had bought gold for 18 consecutive months, which was its longest shopping spree on record.Looking at Singapore’s gold reserves, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is the sixth biggest gold buyer so far this year. It is also the only developed market central bank to increase its gold reserves.In an interview with Kitco News, George Milling-Stanley, Chief Gold Strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said that he expects China to continue buying gold, even if its purchases will be less consistent than this past year and a half.
Milling-Stanley also said that he expects Asian demand to continue to play a dominant role in the gold market.“Investment demand in that part of the world, the Far East, the Middle East, India, subcontinent, and so on, has always had a major influence on the price, and the more it grows, the more influence it's going to have,” he said. “Population growth has been fastest through the emerging markets for the 50 years I've looked at gold. Economic growth has been fastest in the emerging markets all the time I've been looking at gold. Both of those factors will dictate who takes the most gold.”"
39,"Jun 13, 2024","State Street’s Milling-Stanley upgrades gold forecast, sees prices trading between $2,200 and $2,500 in H2 2024","(Kitco News) - The gold market has seen elevated volatility in recent weeks amid dynamic shifts in interest rate expectations; however, one market strategist said that the precious metal remains well supported even as the Federal Reserve hesitates to cut interest rates anytime soon.In an interview with Kitco News, George Milling-Stanley, Chief Gold Strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said that gold remains an attractive asset as the world remains rife with uncertainty. While the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to embark on an easing cycle could limit gold’s gains in the near term, Milling-Stanley said he doesn’t see this as a significant headwind.Milling-Stanley said that although the Fed is not ready to cut rates now, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear Wednesday that the central bank is not looking to raise interest rates again.“The pressure, I think, should remain on the U.S. dollar even if we’re only going to get one rate hike this year,” he said. “Ultimately, we are still in line for a period of Fed easing once we get a slowdown in the economy.”In the current climate, Milling-Stanley and his team at State Street are increasing their base-case price range for gold through the second half of the year. Milling-Stanley said that they now see gold prices trading between $2,200 and $2,500 an ounce.The firm’s new price range is up significantly from its initial base case range between $1,900 and $2,200 an ounce. At the start of the year, Milling-Stanley also ascribed a 30% chance to gold pushing above $2,400 an ounce.Milling-Stanley said that his gold price upgrade reflects heightened uncertainty worldwide.“People are nervous about what’s still going on in Ukraine, people are nervous over what will happen with China over Taiwan, people are nervous about all the elections, and they are nervous about the economy,” he said. “Are consumers prepared for the Federal Reserve’s expected slowdown? Hell no, and that is a scary thought. We are surrounded by uncertainty and what asset does well during uncertain times?”Although Milling-Stanley is bullish on gold through the rest of the year, he added that he doesn’t rule out prices remaining volatile. However, he pointed out that this is the natural function of the market as investors take profits.“Given the rally, investors have had very, very big profits to take,” he said.Milling-Stanley said that what will ultimately propel gold higher is the realization that U.S. monetary policy isn’t supportive of a strong dollar and will be even less supportive as the economy weakens.“There is always a danger that the Fed will do what it has done so often in the past, which is to adopt the right course and then stick to that course for too long so that it becomes the wrong course,” he said.  “People will soon start to realize that the pressure is not on gold right now; the pressure is really on the dollar.”"
40,"Jun 13, 2024",Four central banks sign new framework to enable responsible gold sourcing from small-scale miners in domestic currency,"
(Kitco News) – The World Gold Council (WGC) announced on Wednesday that four central banks have committed to signing ‘The London Principles’, a set of operating guidelines for responsibly sourcing gold from small-scale domestic miners.
The London Principles are a set of operating principles to help structure and formalize Central Bank Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Domestic Purchase Programmes (ASGM DPP), and the four inaugural signatories are the central banks of Colombia, Ecuador, Mongolia, and the Philippines. The WGC said in the announcement that the commitment of these institutions “represents progress towards more responsible gold sourcing practices worldwide.”
“The World Gold Council is committed to improving transparency, trust and integrity across the entire value chain,” said David Tait, chief executive officer of the World Gold Council. “By using the market power and visibility of central banks, who are often the largest or even sole legal buyer of ASGM production in their countries, we hope to instill responsible gold sourcing practices in countries where ASGM is prevalent.”
Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an important source of livelihood for ordinary people in many gold-producing countries, with some estimates suggesting that 15 million people around the world make their living from ASGM. “However, [ASGM] is often unfortunately associated with illicit activities, lack of environmental protection, labour abuses, and other harmful practices,” the WGC said. “ASGM DPPs offer a route to help bring responsible artisanal and small-scale gold miners into the formal supply chain.”
In recent years, some central banks have launched programs to buy gold produced by domestic artisanal and small-scale gold miners in local currency. “The schemes are mutually beneficial as small-scale miners can sell their production to a trustworthy source that offers transparent buying processes and pricing,” the WGC noted. “In addition, central banks can add gold to their official reserves using their local currency, allowing them to grow their reserve assets without having to sacrifice other hard currency reserves.”
As gold is priced and sold in U.S. dollars internationally, the ability for countries to purchase domestic gold in their own currency can be a significant advantage over acquiring bullion through the global gold markets.
“Over the last two years we have worked with central banks who operate ASGM DPPs to exchange best practices and learn from experts,” said Head of Asia-Pacific (ex-China) & Global Head of Central Banks Shaokai Fan at the World Gold Council. “We are pleased to see the group evolve into ‘The signatories of The London Principles’, a trusted circle of central banks who adhere to the most stringent requirements for ASGM DPPs.”
“The participants in this initiative believe that well-structured ASGM DPPs have the potential to contribute to sustainable development, support formalisation and raise ESG standards,” Fan added.
Tait called it “a critical moment for artisanal and small-scale gold miners,” and said the WGC envisions that the original signatory banks “will provide a blueprint for others that are considering how to help formalise domestic ASGM to the benefit of their economies and the people who earn a livelihood from this industry.”
The 12 London Principles encompass commitments to: Legal frameworks, resourcing and transparency; Community well-being; Mercury reduction; Due diligence; Progressive improvement; Formalization; Incentives; Rule of law; Accessibility; Access to ‘clean’ finance; Refining purchased gold; and International cooperation."
41,"Jun 13, 2024","Gold, silver see strong losses as USDX rallies amid hawkish Fed","(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are sharply lower and near daily lows in midday U.S. trading Thursday. A rally in the U.S. dollar index and a hawkish Federal Reserve are trumping tame U.S. inflation reports late this week. August gold was last down $39.70 at $2,315.40. July silver hit a five-week low and was last down $1.322 at $28.945.
Technical selling was also featured in gold and silver markets today as the near-term chart postures for both metals have turned more bearish recently.
Today’s U.S. producer price index report for May came in at down 0.2%, month-on-month, versus market expectations for up 0.1% and compares to the April report’s rise of 0.5%. The core PPI in May (minus food and energy) came in at unchanged versus up 0.3% expected, month-on-month, and compares to a rise of 0.5% in the April report. The tame PPI report today followed a tamer consumer price index report on Wednesday.
However, the Federal Reserve Wednesday delivered a surprisingly hawkish outlook. The FOMC members revised U.S. rate-cut expectations to one cut from three cuts that were expected in March. Updated Fed projections also included upward revisions to U.S. inflation in 2024 and 2025 to 2.6% (2.4% in March) and 2.3% (2.2% in March), respectively. The Fed did hold its monetary policy steady at this week’s meeting. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at his press conference said the latest inflation numbers lower than expected but may not have been fully reflecting the latest quarterly Fed projections. The hawkish Fed has helped to boost the U.S. dollar index late this week. However, U.S. Treasury yields Thursday did dip just a bit, suggesting bond traders think the Fed will still cut interest rates later this year.
The other key outside market today sees Nymex crude oil prices near steady and trading around $78.50 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently around 4.25%.

Technically, August gold bulls have quickly lost their slight overall near-term technical advantage. A bear flag or bearish pennant pattern has formed on the daily bar chart. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at last week’s high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at $2,250.00.

42,"Jun 13, 2024","Saudi Arabia ends petrodollar agreement: What it means for the USD, Bitcoin, and gold","(Kitco News) – The established financial world order of the past 50 years is now transitioning to a new and unknown paradigm as the petrodollar agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia was allowed to expire this past Sunday. 
 
The term ‘petrodollar’ described the U.S. dollar’s (USD) role as the currency used for crude oil transactions on the world market. It traces back to the early 1970s when the United States and Saudi Arabia struck a deal shortly after the U.S. went off the gold standard – and the agreement has had far-reaching consequences for the global economy.
 
The petrodollar agreement came about following the 1973 oil crisis. It stipulated that Saudi Arabia would price its oil exports exclusively in U.S. dollars and invest its surplus oil revenues in U.S. Treasury bonds. In exchange, the U.S. provided military support and protection to the kingdom. 
 
This helped the USD cement its position as the world’s reserve currency and ushered in an era of prosperity for Americans as they enjoyed the benefits of being the preferred market for global corporations to sell their wares. Additionally, the inflow of foreign capital into U.S. Treasury bonds has supported low interest rates and a robust bond market.
 
All that is set to change now as Saudi Arabia is looking to move beyond an exclusive relationship with the U.S. – as evidenced by the kingdom becoming one of the newest members of the BRICS bloc. 
 
While many point to escalating global tensions and shifting geopolitical allegiances as the impetus for allowing the agreement to expire, changes in the power dynamics of the global oil market have also played a crucial role in this development as the world moves towards alternative energy sources. 
 
The rise of renewables and natural gas has been steadily reducing the world’s reliance on oil for the past decade, and even oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia have evolved. 
 
The Kingdom is on track to generate half its electricity with renewables and natural gas by 2030 and plans to plant 10 billion trees as part of a larger goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2060. To achieve this, they have implemented more than 80 public and private sector initiatives representing an investment of over $188 billion. 
 
Their decision to go in that direction has also been influenced by the emergence of new oil-producing nations, such as Brazil and Canada, which have challenged the traditional dominance of the Middle East.
 
While many analysts have said that the threat to the USD’s status as the reserve currency is overblown, most acknowledge that the expiration of the petrodollar agreement has the long-term potential to weaken the USD and, by extension, U.S. financial markets. 
 
At present, the Kingdom is still accepting U.S. dollars in exchange for oil, but some of the world’s largest economies are attempting to change that, notably China. For years, China has been actively trying to get Saudi Arabia to accept the yuan for oil purchases, and while the Kingdom has thus far refrained from making the switch, they have expressed openness to the idea. 
 
According to digital news service Sputnik, “Nearly 80 percent of global oil sales are priced in dollars. However, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, and others are increasingly shifting to local currencies in energy trade. In 2023, 20 percent of global oil was bought in other currencies, as per the Wall Street Journal.”
 

The Kingdom’s acceptance into the BRICS bloc has the potential to influence this decision. If Saudi Arabia moves to expand beyond the USD, it would materially weaken the currency’s dominance in the oil market – and as a result, its place on the world stage. A decline in global demand for the greenback could result in higher inflation, higher interest rates, and a weaker bond market in the United States.
 
Sputnik said, “If world players significantly reduce the use of US dollars, the US' ability to issue dollar debt and earn dollars for exports will diminish and the nation's economy will shrink, according to international economists.” 
 
The primary reasons for not making the switch at this point are the stability and the global acceptance of the U.S. dollar. While the USD-for-oil status quo remains in effect for the time being, the expiration of the petrodollar agreement represents a significant shift in global power dynamics and highlights the changing energy landscape and the growing influence of emerging economies.
 
Evidence that the U.S. understands the importance of maintaining a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia can be found in reports that the Biden administration is close to finalizing a treaty with the Kingdom that would commit the U.S. to help defend them as part of a deal aimed at encouraging diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel. 
 
As reported by Reuters, “The possible deal, widely telegraphed by U.S. and other officials for weeks, is part of a wider package that would include a U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear pact, steps toward the establishment of a Palestinian state and an end to the war in Gaza, where months of ceasefire efforts have failed to bring peace.”
 
The treaty, known as the Strategic Alliance Agreement, would require a two-thirds majority vote in the U.S. Senate to be approved. According to U.S. and Saudi officials, the draft treaty is modeled loosely on Washington's mutual security pact with Japan.
 
In exchange for the U.S. commitment to defend Saudi Arabia in an attack, the draft treaty would grant Washington access to Saudi territory and airspace to protect U.S. interests and regional partners, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
 
Effect on USD, Bitcoin and gold
 
“The end of the US-Saudi petrodollar agreement would likely have a minimal effect on the USD,” said Daniel Krupka, Head of Research at Coin Bureau, in a note to Kitco Crypto. “This is because Saudi Arabia would likely convert the non-USD currencies it's receiving for oil payments into the USD anyways.”
 
“Although a BRICS currency may have some level of adoption, it would not be able to achieve the level of adoption similar to that of the USD, gold, or Bitcoin without being backed by a stable economy,” he added. “Neither party benefits from the end of the agreement in the short term as it effectively just complicates things. In the long term, it could make Saudi Arabia less reliant on the USD depending on what the country does with its non-USD proceeds.”
 
Touching on the draft defense treaty, Krupka said it “may maintain the bilateral relationship at the strategic level, but it does not directly replace the economic aspect of the petrodollar deal.”
 
He also noted that the “Saudi Riyal is pegged to the USD,” which means that “Saudi Arabia needs USD to support its currency.”
 
“However, the end of the agreement could be bad for the USD insofar as Saudi Arabia decides to convert these non-USD currency proceeds into other assets, such as gold or BTC,” Krupka suggested. “More diversification of Saudi assets into gold or Bitcoin could help push up prices, although this is contingent on the extent of diversification.”
 

""The symbolism of the end of the US-Saudi petrodollar agreement marks a shift toward a future that is further economically and geopolitically fragmented,” said Brian Mahoney, co-founder of Acre, in a note shared with Kitco Crypto. “It means that the world’s currency for top energy assets like oil is no longer priced just in dollars, opening the door to alternative assets instead.”
 
“Bitcoin would make sense as an asset to be explored for adoption going forward given its ties to energy companies (through its proof of work consensus mechanism) and the fact that it is the top digitally native asset by market cap in an increasingly digital global economy,” he added.
 
While the details on the future of a BRICS currency are scant, Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday, “Within BRICS, we’re working on shaping an independent payment system, free from political pressure, abuse and external sanctional interference.”
 
Some have suggested that a BRICS currency could be backed by a basket of commodities, of which gold would be a part – which would likely benefit gold prices. 
 
Most analysts hold the position that it will be years before the USD loses its reserve currency status, but X user Bullion Buzz highlighted the ongoing ramp-up in the transition away from Western currencies amid the rise in geopolitical tensions. 
Jaime Carrasco, Senior Investment Advisor and Senior Portfolio Manager at Canaccord Genuity Financial said “What is important to every Western investor is the fact that the #Petrodollar is being replaced in #oil sales with the #gold convertible #Petroyuan contract, and I'm sure Saudi Arabia the UAE and Iran, like Russia, will be glad to accept #gold in trade settlement for their oil instead of USD.”
 
In response to a post from Gold Telegraph highlighting that “Gold has overtaken the euro in global international reserves,” Carrasco said, “Great infographics which begs one question, at what price will it be when it overtakes the mighty USD?”
 
He also noted that “Saudi Arabia has announced that they will be joining Bank of International Settlements’s mBridge payment system and thus leaving the Petrodollar system as the only payment system for energy.” 
 
And X user Doctor Profit said the end of the agreement would lead to more debt printing in the U.S., ultimately leading to increased inflation. 
“It’s more a long-term rise,” he added. “Affects from this change will be seen in 8-12 months from today. Outcome is rising inflation and higher prices for everything, including stocks, BTC, real estate, and gold.”"

Carleton spoke to Kitco Mining in early June at THE Mining Investment Event of the North in Quebec City.

The CSE has offices in Vancouver and Toronto. It has over 800 listings.
Gold has hit several all-time highs in 2024, but resource companies are not seeing much of a lift, noted Carleton.
""The index of gold exploration companies, even the later stage companies that have extended their projects to quite a considerable degree...still haven't gotten the love from the markets in terms of the valuations at this point,"" said Carleton.
In the spring, the Canadian federal government proposed a rise in the capital gains tax. Starting June 25, the capital gains inclusion rate would be increased from one-half to two-thirds for capital gains of over $250,000 per year for Canadians, and on all capital gains for corporations and most types of trusts, according to a statement by the Canadian finance ministry.
Carleton said the proposed changes will have “a devastating impact on flow-through financing and other means of direct investment into exploration and mining” in Canada.

August gold was last down $21.00 at $2,333.40. July silver hit a five-week low overnight and was last down $0.827 at $29.45.
(Just a note to remind that Comex gold and silver futures markets’ official closes and daily settlements occur just after midday. Thus, on busy afternoons in the markets, such as Wednesday, the following day’s differences in daily price changes between futures and spot can be large, due to gold and silver futures prices settling at midday—before important news developments such as Wednesday’s FOMC meeting conclusion.)
Today’s U.S. producer price index report for May came in at down 0.2%, month-on-month, versus market expectations for up 0.1% and compares to the April report’s rise of 0.5%. The core PPI in May (minus food and energy) came in at unchanged versus up 0.3% expected, month-on-month, and compares to a rise of 0.5% in the April report.
Traders and investors today are still digesting a busy and important trading day Wednesday that saw a tame U.S. consumer price index report but more-hawkish-than-expected Federal Reserve FOMC meeting results. The precious metals, stock and U.S. Treasury markets bulls were humming along quite well in the aftermath of the cooler CPI print Wednesday morning. And then the Fed delivered a surprisingly hawkish outlook early Wednesday afternoon. The FOMC members revised U.S. rate-cut expectations to one cut from three cuts that were expected in March. Updated Fed projections also included upward revisions to U.S. inflation in 2024 and 2025 to 2.6% (2.4% in March) and 2.3% (2.2% in March), respectively. The Fed did hold its monetary policy steady at this week’s meeting. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at his press conference said the latest inflation numbers lower than expected but may not have been fully reflecting the latest quarterly Fed projections. The precious metals, the U.S. stock index and U.S. Treasury markets all lost some steam after the Fed statement and Powell presser.
Still, a Barron’s headline today reads: “Markets remain confident of cuts despite Fed.” The story said “traders seem to think they know more than the Federal Reserve about where interest rates are going.” Indeed, that’s a fair criticism as the past couple years have seen the Fed behind the curve on actual U.S. economic developments, and the U.S. central bank could now be behind the curve on problematic inflation actually being tamped down. Today’s cooler PPI report falls in line with that notion.
Asian and European stock indexes were mixed overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward mixed openings when the New York day session begins.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index firmer following Wednesday’s sell off. Nymex crude oil prices are a bit lower and trading around $78.15 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently around 4.25%.
Other U.S. economic data released Thursday saw a bigger-than-expected rise in weekly jobless claims.

Technically, August gold bulls have the slight overall near-term technical advantage. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at last week’s high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the June low of $2,304.20. First resistance is seen at $2,350.00 and then at $2,375.00.

45,"Jun 13, 2024","Gold prices remain under pressure, ignoring 0.2% drop in US PPI","(Kitco News) - The gold market continues to see solid selling pressure even as producers saw weak price pressure last month.
The Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 0.2% in May, following April’s 0.5% increase, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The latest inflation data was significantly cooler than expected, as economists looked for a 0.1% increase.
In the last 12 months headline wholesale inflation increased 2.2%, the report said. 
At the same time, core PPI, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, was unchanged last month. Economists were forecasting a 0.3% increase. Annual core PPI increased 2.3%.
The gold market is off its lows but continues to see solid technical selling pressure after it was unable to hold support at $2,350 an ounce. August gold futures last traded at $2,380 an ounce, down 0.71% on the day. 
However, some market analysts have said that falling producer prices could give the Federal Reserve confidence to ease interest rates as early as September, supporting gold’s long-term uptrend.
“Fed funds futures are back to fully pricing in two cuts this year,” said Adam Button, Head of Currency Strategy at Forexlive.com
PPI is seen as a leading inflation indicator as producers pass on higher costs to their customers. "

47,"Jun 12, 2024",A peak in global rates is good for gold BoC and ECB can continue to lower interest rates without the Fed,"(Kitco News) - Although the Federal Reserve could still lower interest rates one or two times this year, it continues to signal that it is not in a hurry to adjust its monetary policy just yet.
However, analysts note that despite the U.S.’s reluctance to ease interest rates, the gold market remains well supported as global rates start to fall. The diverging monetary policies in the global marketplace are being driven by the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank, both of which have cut interest rates due to easing inflation pressures in their respective economies.
Analysts have said that while the Federal Reserve remains the most significant driver for gold, the fact that global rates have peaked should provide some support for the precious metal. Despite the Federal Reserve’s stance to hold rates at restrictive levels, gold has held critical support at $2,300 an ounce.
According to the latest comments from the Bank of Canada and Germany’s Bundesbank, a member of the ECB, investors can expect to see further divergence in global monetary policies that could support gold prices.
Speaking at the 30th annual Conference of Montreal by the International Economic Forum of the Americas, BoC Governor Tiff Macklem provided the most explicit monetary policy outlook.
“If the economy evolves broadly in line with our own forecast, if inflation continues to ease, it is reasonable to expect further interest rate cuts,” he said.
However, Macklem added that while interest rates have room to move lower, they will still be higher than they were before the pandemic.
“Global interest rates are probably not returning to pre-pandemic levels. The new normal won't be the old normal. And if we're not going back, well, we all have to adjust,” he said.
Bundesbank President Dr. Joachim Nagel was less explicit in his monetary outlook. He reiterated the ECB’s stance that it remains data-dependent and that decisions will be made meeting by meeting.
However, he provided markets with some optimism that the central bank expects inflation to be under control.
“In this uncertain world, we have to be very cautious, not showing any complacency in our mandate to fight against inflation,” he said. “I have once described inflation as a greedy beast. We are in a situation where we have tamed this greedy beast, but our task is not done.”
Although the ECB has tempered further rate cut expectations, markets are pricing in two rate cuts this year. In Canada, markets are expecting to see three rate cuts by year-end.
Talking about the divergence in global interest rates, Macklem said that so far, the market has been able to absorb this difference. While there is a limit to how much the Bank of Canada can do without the Federal Reserve, Macklem said they are not there yet.
Nagel said that given the different inflationary environments, it makes sense for the ECB to cut rates before the Federal Reserve, something that has never happened before. "
48,"Jun 12, 2024","Fed may cut later than ECB, BoC, but cut they shall, and gold will soar – David Rosenberg","
(Kitco News) – The Fed may be late to the party but once they begin cutting, history says gold will take off, according to David Rosenberg, founder and president at Rosenberg Research.
In a recent interview with BNN Bloomberg, Rosenberg was asked about the interest rate divergence between the Federal Reserve and other developed economies after both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada cut rates last week, and whether he expects those banks to continue cutting.
“The Fed has already told you that it's a waiting game for them,” Rosenberg said. “I've been doing this for 40 years. Whenever any central bank… look at [ECB President] Christine Lagarde last week. Whenever they start to cut rates they never want the markets to leapfrog them, to front-run them, so they're always cautious at the first rate cut.”
Rosenberg said that he expects things to play out the same way when the United States begins their own rate-cutting cycle. “You're going to see when the Fed cuts rates later this year I think that they will start in September,” he said. “Powell's going to actually sound pretty hawkish or cautious, that's just the way things go in central banking.”
Rosenberg said that markets aren’t yet accounting for the number of cuts that are to come. “What's happening is that there is not enough Bank of Canada easing priced in, and as these interest rate differentials widen against the Canadian dollar – and there's nothing more important for any currency than relative interest rate differentials, by the way, and that includes the Canadian dollar which is also commodity based – the Loonie’s going to go down.”
He added that he sees a weaker CAD as a positive development. “It should go down,” Rosenberg said. “We need the weaker Canadian dollar. The economy needs that sort of stimulus right now.”
Rosenberg was then asked whether he still likes gold as an investment, following its dramatic rally and the sudden pullback after China’s central bank announced a pause in purchases. 
“Remember, it's Rosenberg, not Goldberg, just to set the record straight,” he joked before adding, “you can look at the moving averages and sentiment and trade around gold, [but] for us, for years it's been buy and hold, a diversifier in the portfolio.”
“But we are going into a global interest rate cut cycle,” he emphasized. “It doesn't matter if the Fed’s the last man standing, the Fed will be cutting rates, and the U.S. dollar might not weaken initially, but next year when the Fed plays catch-up to everybody else, the U.S. dollar will be weakening.”
Rosenberg said that another thing he liked about the yellow metal’s recent rally is that it hasn’t been limited to the greenback.  
“What I liked about gold, in particular in this rally to the highs, is that it was making a high in every currency, not just the U.S. dollar, which is telling you something, that this is a real, bona fide bull market in bullion,” he said. “You just have to look at the history books, and look at the relationship, that when you go into a global interest rate cutting cycle, which we are in the early stages, gold does very well in that environment.”"
49,"Jun 12, 2024","Gold prices trying to hold the line at $2,350 as Federal Reserve leaves rates unchanged signals one rate cuts this year","(Kitco News) - The gold market is struggling to hold the line at $2,350 an ounce as the Federal Reserve continues to pare down its interest rate cut expectations.
As expected, the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged within a range of 5.25% to 5.50%.
The updated economic projections show the central bank sees one rate cut this year, down from three estimated in March. The Federal Reserve's interest rate estimate, also known as the dot plot, shows the Fed funds rate ending the year above 5.00%.
While holding positive gains, the gold market has fallen slightly below $2,350 an ounce, which has proven to be a critical resistance point. August gold futures last traded at $2,345.80 an ounce, up 0.79% on the day.
According to some economists, the U.S. central bank continues to keep its options open as inflation remains stubbornly elevated. However, the central bank did tweet its comment on inflation.
“Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective,” the central bank said in its monetary policy statement.
Looking at the economic projections, the central bank kept its GDP forecast unchanged at 2.1% growth for this year and 2.0% growth in 2025 and 2026.
The Federal Reserve also expects the U.S. labor market to remain healthy, with the unemployment rate rising this year to 4.0%, unchanged from the March forecast. It is expected to rise to 4.2% next year and 4.1% in 2026, up from 4.1% and 4.0%, respectively, in the previous estimate.
Looking at inflation, the central bank still doesn’t expect core PCE inflation to hit the 2% target until 2026. Core inflation is expected to rise to 2.8% this year, up from 2.6% projected in March. Inflation is expected to rise to 2.3% next year, up from the prior forecast of 2.2%.
Headline inflation is also expected to be higher this year and next before cooling in 2026. The central bank sees inflation rising to 2.6% this year, up from the previous estimate of 2.4%. Inflation is expected to rise to 2.3% next year, up from 2.2% projected in March.
Although the Fed has signaled only one rate cut this year, some economists note that it is a close call as eight out of 19 central banks still see two rate cuts. Ashworth, Chief North America Economist at Capital Economics, said that everything depends on the health of the economy.
“Overall, there’s nothing here that rules out a September rate cut. It all depends on the incoming data. If employment growth edges down again and the May price data prove to be the start of a renewed disinflationary trend, as we expect, then two rate cuts this year are still the most likely outcome,” he said."
50,"Jun 12, 2024",Geopolitical uncertainty is impacting the global economy and driving gold demand,"
(Kitco News) - Geopolitical uncertainty, which has fueled the de-dollarization trend and fragmentation in the global economy, has been a significant factor in gold’s unprecedented run to record highs above $2,450 this year.
According to industry and government experts at the 30th annual Conference of Montreal by the International Economic Forum of the Americas, this trend remains firmly in place, which should continue to support the precious metal’s uptrend.
The deglobalization trend has been a key theme in many of the panel discussions organized during the three-day conference.
“It’s extraordinary to me to see how rapidly we've moved from a situation where globalization seemed inevitable to where today it increasingly seems impossible,” said Perrin Beatty, a former Progressive Conservative Cabinet Minister and President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
Beatty narrated a discussion on the rise of economic nationalism, with the panelists noting that broad international trade agreements are being replaced with narrower agreements.
The panelists noted that the evolving trend of economic nationalism is increasing costs for businesses around the world, contributing to elevated inflation pressures.
“We are all disadvantaged by this trend. Every businessperson in the room knows how much more expensive it is, and it's only going to get more expensive,” said Jeff Nankivell, President and CEO of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada.
However, Nankivell noted that Canada’s pursuit of individual agreements is better than having no agreements.
“We have all these different trade agreements, but they all have different conditions attached to them. Many of them have side agreements that are trading rules you have to follow if you're going to benefit from the agreement. It’s really far from optimal, but we have to do our best,” Nankivell said.
Ali Borhani, Managing Director of 3Sixty Strategic Advisors Ltd and co-founder and host of the BRI Dialogues, discussed the role of Canada and Europe in the global economy as the two are stuck between the American Eagle and the Chinese Dragon. He said that it is important to recognize that the world is changing and to acknowledge the reasons for this change. He explained that there is a collective feeling of disillusion among the Global South towards developed nations in the Northern Hemisphere.
He pointed out that the expansion of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) is an indication that a new multi-polar world has been established.
“Half of the world population is in BRICS+. Two-thirds of world trade happens in BRICS+. BRICS are adding 74 million consumers a year. That is two times Canada out of these markets,” Borhani said. “The largest buyers of energy and the largest sellers of energy happen to be in the Global South and among BRICS. So we're looking at the rewiring of energy, finance, supply chain, and tech.”
He said that developing nations in the South are seeing growing double standards as richer nations impose their rules and agendas, such as the green energy transition. He added that the U.S. weaponization of the dollar against Russia for its war against Ukraine is also seen as a threat.
“The Global South is confused because the Global South hears, ‘everything net-zero, don't drill,’ and the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund now is digging at the bottom of the ocean. But no more oil for you in the Global South,” he said.
As emerging markets have become more disappointed with Western policies, China has been able to grow its influence. Borhani used a famous quote from Larry Summers, the US Secretary of the Treasury, to highlight this shift in influence in the developing world. “Every time you guys come here, Europeans and Americans, you give us a lecture. Every time the Chinese come, they give us an airport, a hospital,” he said.
Carlos Díaz-Rosillo, Founding Director of the Adam Smith Center for Economic Freedom at Florida International University, agreed with Borhani in the discussion, noting that Western nations have never shown up to help build the needed infrastructure in emerging markets.
“The United States has gone around the world, telling countries to choose. And I think one of the biggest failures of American foreign policy, and this is a bipartisan failure, is not providing an alternative [to China],” Díaz-Rosillo said. “We have to have a restructuring of foreign policy so that we work hand in hand with the private sector, so that those services and those projects that are badly needed have an American presence, have a European presence. We make the choice much easier for these countries to choose, to choose America, to choose Europe instead of China.”
However, it is not just the growing divide between developed nations and emerging market countries. Bernard Spitz, CEO and Founder of BS CONSEIL, said that there is significant fragmentation in Europe.
“We have had the [European] election just two days ago and we can see that Europeans are not aligned. So when we are talking about trade issues, if we are not aligned, it means that we are on a dangerous path,” he said. “If you have the addition of the French vision, the German vision, the Italian vision, etc., it's not a European policy. It's chaos.”
Climate change adds to economic uncertainty
Although some emerging markets have felt targeted by the West’s focus on the green energy transition, many executives at the conference said climate change is a threat that must be addressed.
In a discussion about the costs of decarbonization, panelists noted that emissions don’t acknowledge any borders and that emerging market economies are experiencing the greatest impact of climate change as volatile weather wreaks havoc, from destructive storms to devastating droughts worldwide.
An annual global investment of $5 trillion in energy transition technologies is necessary to combat the effects of climate change, the panelists said.
“Right now, it costs about $3 trillion to $6 trillion because we've delayed, really, for now about seven, eight years,” said Margaret Franklin, President and CEO of CFA Institute. “It's going to cost more every year that we don't invest and we don't address it.”
Franklin added that despite the high price tag, a cost-benefit analysis shows a break-even point on the investment.
“It's estimated by 2050, the impact of climate change on infrastructure, agriculture, healthcare, you name it, will cost us $38 trillion per annum,” she said.
Nicolás Albertoni, Uruguay’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, suggested that addressing climate change is a way to combat economic nationalism.
“If we want to be part of this global value chain, we have to be sustainable. We have to be the country in Latin America that is not just promoting a port, a platform, but also a sustainable perspective of development,” he said.
Solutions to address the growing geopolitical divide
Paul Slaby, Managing Director of Canada’s Semiconductor Council, suggested that technology could help promote a new type of globalism as economies rely heavily on microchips.
Slaby said that it will be impossible for one nation to control the global chip supply chain, but that there are opportunities for nations like Canada to build a niche integral space within the supply chain.
John Gallagher, Managing Director at Cerberus Capital Management’s Supply Chain and Strategic Opportunities team, told the conference that a strong supply of critical metals in North America could help establish stability in the global economy, reducing China’s influence in the marketplace.
Cerberus Capital Management is currently investing $50 million in Torngat Metals, which is developing its Strange Lake Rare Earth Project in Nunavik in Northern Quebec. Strange Lake is considered the largest critical metals deposit outside of China.
“A secure and resilient supply chain is nothing short of the center of gravity of modern national and economic security,” he said."
51,"Jun 12, 2024","Gold, silver post sharp gains on tame U.S. CPI; FOMC on deck","(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are solidly higher in midday U.S. trading Wednesday, following a U.S. inflation report that came in tame and in turn sunk the U.S. dollar index and U.S. Treasury yields. Now, precious metals trades are bracing for this afternoon’s FOMC meeting conclusion. August gold was last up $25.00 at $2,351.80. July silver was last up $0.974 at $30.21.
The U.S. consumer price index report for May, out Wednesday morning, came in at unchanged, month-on-month and up 3.3%, year-on-year. Monthly CPI was seen up 0.1% and up 3.4%, annually. The core CPI (excluding food and energy) for May was up 0.2%, month-on-month and up 3.4%, annually. Both core numbers were also slightly lower than expected. This CPI report falls into the camp of the U.S. monetary policy doves, who want to see the Federal Reserve cut interest rates sooner rather than later.  
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently at 4.256%--well down from the 4.40 reading just before the CPI print.
Precious metals traders are reckoning the tamer CPI will indeed allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates later this year. And if the Fed starts to ease its monetary policy, the other major central banks of the world are likely to follow. The European Central Bank last week began what could be a process of major central banks easing their money policies over the coming months, or longer. Easier monetary policies suggest more upbeat consumer spending attitudes amid lower borrowing costs. That scenario would mean better global demand for raw commodities, including the metals.
Traders and investors await the results of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of the Federal Reserve that ends Wednesday afternoon with a statement and press conference from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. No changes in U.S. monetary policy are expected at this week’s meeting but as always the rhetoric coming from the Fed will be parsed by the marketplace. Don’t be surprised to see the FOMC and Powell take today’s tamer CPI data as an opportunity to lean less hawkish on U.S. money policy. It could also be that today’s CPI report will usurp the FOMC statement and Powell press conference, regarding market significance.
The other key outside market today sees Nymex crude oil prices a bit higher and trading around $78.25 a barrel.

Technically, August gold bulls have gained the slight overall near-term technical advantage. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at last week’s high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the May low of $2,308.70. First resistance is seen at $2,375.00 and then at $2,400.00. First support is seen at the overnight low of $2,327.20 and then at Tuesday’s low of $2,314.50. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 5.5.

52,"Jun 12, 2024","U.S. dollar remains unchallenged, but small changes in reserves have major impact on gold price – HSBC’s Steel","
(Kitco News) – The U.S. dollar’s place as the world’s reserve currency won’t be threatened for decades, but even minor changes to central banks’ reserves have a massive impact on the gold market, according to HSBC Securities Chief Commodities Analyst James Steel.
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Steel was asked about the issue of de-dollarization.
“That's been ascribed to some of the reasons that central banks, not just China, have been buying gold,” Steel said. “We don't believe that there's going to be any loss of sovereignty for the U.S. dollar as far as the world's reserve currency goes, for the next 10, 20 years, as far as we can see, for reasons that would take an entire program, you and I could talk about it.”
But Steel made a point of saying that even a small change in central banks’ reserve allocations would have major implications for commodities like precious metals.
“That's not to say that every single central bank in the world wants as many dollars as they do have,” he said. “They may want to reduce their reserves by, say, 65% to 62%. So what do you do with that 3%? Well, they're very limited as to what they can buy, both in fixed income and for currencies, and there may be a reason that they wouldn't want to buy the euro or the yen.”
“Gold provides a perfect sweet spot of getting out of the dollar without going into something else,” he said.
Steel was then asked what trade people most want to talk to him about these days. “Well, trying to figure out gold,” he said.
“I’ve just come back from Europe, and both in Europe and North America, the previous [gold] rallies have had a clear smoking gun,” Steel said. “This one hasn't so much. And that's what makes it so interesting.”
Steel said that the most recent rally has been driven by multiple factors. “There's geopolitics going on as well,” he said. “You can come to me and you can say, ‘Jim, what happens to gold?’ Usually when the Fed cuts by 50 basis points or when it increases, or when the dollar goes up this much or down this much…”
“But Gaza is different from Ukraine,” he said. “It's different from the South China Sea, it’s different from the Taiwan Straits. So every geopolitical event may have a different impact on gold.”
Steel was also asked about the difference in retail prices for gold jewelry in stores like Tiffany’s compared to the metal itself.
“It's very, very high, it’s hundreds of percent,” he said. “Hundreds of percent, but you're paying for the artistry and you're paying for the workmanship. It's well worth it. It hasn't dimmed the demand at the high end.”
“It's one of the reasons the [U.S. jewelry] gold price doesn't change,” he added, “whereas in Asia, you'll see that the markup is very low and the prices change rapidly in the shops.”
Back in April, Steel warned that the piling in of momentum traders into the gold market had increased the odds of sudden and sharp slides in price.
“I think you have to look at the genesis of the [rally],” Steel said at the time. “In addition to geopolitical risks, which are significant, we've also had a lot of extraneous players coming into the market in the past several months, who I think are not so much interested in the price of gold as such, but they wish to hedge their equity exposure. There's a lot of debate in the equity markets about how high equities can go, and many managers, fund managers, pension managers, et cetera, have no alternative but to be in equities.”
“But they do have a choice about if they hedge, and if they hedge that risk,” he added. “And gold is a proven safe haven in that regard.”
Steel said gold’s rapid rise has pulled in many momentum traders, which increases the likelihood of a sharper downward correction. “I think that's where we have to be somewhat concerned, that if we get some days where things are static, we could easily get a pullback in the price,” he said, adding that he’s seeing a lot of demand destruction in the physical markets. “It's getting very expensive for price-sensitive economies to keep buying the underlying physical.”
Steel said that the newly arrived momentum traders “may or may not be well versed in the fundamentals of gold,” but are instead reacting to straightforward buy and sell signals as the gold market approaches record highs in nominal terms, and cautioned that these nominal values can be misleading.
“I would point out for your viewers that gold hit $850 an ounce in January of 1980, which if converted into today's dollars is $3,000, around $3,200,” he said. “Now, I'm not saying we're going to go there by any stretch of the imagination. But I would point out that, from a real term perspective, we're not at historical highs.”
Asked whether nominal all-time high gold prices will spur central banks to become sellers, Steel said that for the most part he expected the opposite.
“Almost one out of every three ounces of gold that was mined in 2022 went into a central bank, and not much less in 2023,” he said. “Now, I think we have seen some slowness this year. They're aware of the price as well, and it is high.”
Steel pointed out some examples of sovereign selling but said that according to the latest numbers, they’re very much in the minority. “The IMF released data a couple of days ago that showed a couple of central banks were sellers in March,” he said. “But I do think, over the long haul, that central banks are on balance, on a committed buy program. But they certainly don't have to buy at the rapacious rate they did in the last two years.”

54,"Jun 12, 2024",Gold prices jump as U.S. CPI cools more than expected,"(Kitco News) - Gold prices are seeing renewed buying momentum as consumer prices cooled more than expected in May, which, according to some economists, could give the Federal Reserve some room to ease interest rates this year.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged last month after April’s  0.3% increase, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. The latest inflation data was weaker than expected, as economists expected a 0.1% increase.
The report said that in the last 12 months, headline inflation rose 3.3%At the same time, core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices increased 0.2%, also missing expectations; according to consensus forecasts, economists were looking for a 0.3% increase. 
The report said that annual core inflation rose 3.4%. Although inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, it is down from last month’s annual increase of 3.6%. Economists were expecting an unchanged reading.
The gold market was seeing some modest buying ahead of the report and has seen renewed bullish momentum in its initial reaction to the inflation data. August gold futures last traded at $2,342.10 an ounce, up 0.62% on the day.
Michael Brown, Senior Research Strategist at Pepperstone, said that the latest inflation data could shift sentiment at the Federal Reserve ahead of its monetary policy decision later in this afternoon
“The May US CPI report is one that should provide the FOMC with some degree of further confidence in the disinflationary process back towards the 2% target, with headline CPI remaining unchanged on an MoM basis, for the first time since last June. Furthermore, core CPI slipped further on an annual basis, hitting a more than 3-year low at 3.4%.
Adam Button, head of currency strategy at Forexlive.com, said that following the inflation data, markets have fully priced in two rate cuts this year, with an 80% chance of a move in September.

On Thursday Weir spoke to Kitco Mining at THE Mining Investment Event of the North in Quebec City.

Lithium prices jumped 10x at the beginning of this decade before crashing. Weir sees signs of a recovery.
""I think a lot of low-grade tons came into the market,"" said Weir. ""We're in a surplus position. With EV penetration continuing to grow, we think we're sort of towards the bottom of that period. Inventories have been depleted, and we think higher prices are coming at us down the road.""
High prices earlier this decade and environmental concerns led to investment into alternate forms of lithium production, such as direct lithium extraction. Weir believes that the big oil companies will come out on top due to their expertise in chemical processing and their deep pockets. In November Exxon Mobil announced that it was drilling its first lithium well in Arkansas, the company’s first phase of North American lithium production in the southwest. The company said it aimed to be a leading supplier for electric vehicles by 2030
""There's a lot of companies putting a lot of capital into [lithium technology], including ExxonMobil,"" said Weir. ""It takes a lot of engineering hours to unlock. Every single project is discrete. If anyone's going to figure it out, it's going to be a company the size of Exxon.""
Lithium Royalty (TSX: LIRC) has 35 royalties. The company added eight last year. Expected producers in 2024 are Tres Quebradas, Mariana, and Das Neves. The company has a cash balance of $9.3 million, and the current market cap is C$391 million.

57,"Jun 11, 2024","Silver prices stabilize above $29/oz, but downside target of $24.66/oz is in play – FX Empire’s Hyerczyk","
(Kitco News) – Silver prices are stabilizing following the sharp slide across precious metals on Friday, but China’s pullback on sovereign gold purchases could mean stagnation and further declines for the grey metal, according to analyst James Hyerczyk at FX Empire.
“Silver prices stabilized on Monday after experiencing the steepest decline in over three years on Friday,” Hyerczyk wrote. “This correction came as disappointing news from China and the U.S. curbed speculator enthusiasm, particularly those banking on Chinese bullion demand and an anticipated interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.”
He said that Friday’s plummeting silver prices were driven by a double whammy of data from Asia and the United States. “This decline was triggered by a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report, which reduced the likelihood of a Fed rate cut in September,” he said. “Additionally, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) paused its bullion purchases after 18 months, disappointing investors who had bet on continued Chinese demand for gold.”
Hyerczyk said that the PBOC has been exerting considerable influence on bullion prices of late, but their buying patterns have been inconsistent.
“Historically, the bank’s buying phases are followed by long breaks, and without resumed purchases of gold, silver prices might remain stagnant,” he said. “Market sentiment was further jolted by Friday’s dramatic move, with expectations of similar volatility this week being low unless there are major surprises in upcoming economic data, particularly the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and the Federal Reserve’s policy decision.”
All eyes are now on the CPI release tomorrow morning, with the Fed’s interest rate decision and new projections coming in the afternoon. “Analysts predict May’s CPI will show cooling headline inflation, though core inflation might remain high, influencing the Fed’s decision-making process,” he said. “The Cleveland Federal Reserve estimates headline inflation at 0.08% and core inflation at 0.3% for May, reflecting cooling energy prices but persistent core pressures.”
Hyerczyk noted that expectations for a Fed rate cut in September dropped from 70% to around 50% following the release of the U.S. employment data, and nobody is expecting a change to the benchmark rate at tomorrow’s meeting.
“Policymakers are closely monitoring shelter and services prices, as these are significant inflation drivers,” he wrote. “The recent robust jobs report suggests the Fed will scrutinize inflation data more intensely before adjusting rates. While May’s CPI is likely to show moderated inflation, the path to the Fed’s 2% target remains protracted.”
Hyerczyk said that in the near term, he expects silver prices to remain under pressure. “With the Fed likely holding off on rate cuts and China’s demand uncertain, the market outlook leans bearish,” he said. “Any positive surprise in the CPI data could, however, shift sentiment temporarily. Traders should stay alert to economic releases and Fed communications this week for clearer market direction.”
Turning to the technical picture, Hyerczyk said that while silver prices have stabilized and have trended upward, the analysis doesn’t look bullish.
“XAG/USD prices are edging higher on Monday, but the market remains vulnerable to further downside pressure with the 50-day moving average at $28.77 the next target,” he said.

“The 50-day MA has been controlling the intermediate uptrend since March 1 so a sustained move under this indicator could cause some significant damage to the chart with the 200-day moving average at $24.66, a potential downside target,” Hyerczyk concluded.
After declining precipitously from the daily high of $29.808 shortly after 6 pm EDT to a session low of $29.032 at 10:30 pm, spot silver has managed to hold above $29.100 since, last trading at $29.255 at the time of writing for a loss of 1.65% on the session."

59,"Jun 11, 2024","Heightened geopolitical uncertainty has supported gold, but Crisis24’s Chad Lesch sees opportunities to ease global tensions","
(Kitco News) - Geopolitical uncertainty has provided significant safe-haven support for gold, and investors should expect this trend to continue as adversaries continue to chip away at the U.S. dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency, according to one risk management executive.
On the sidelines of the annual The Conference of Montreal by the International Economic Forum of the Americas, Chad Lesch, Senior Vice President of Strategic Projects at Crisis24, the world’s leading risk intelligence, crisis management, premier medical, and personal security company, said in an exclusive interview with Kitco News that aside from ongoing conflicts around the world, one of the greatest threats to the global economy is the further weakening of the U.S. dollar.
Prior to joining Crisis24, Lesch spent 15 years at the Central Intelligence Agency as a Covert Action Officer in their Special Activities Center. Lesch now uses his skills to help businesses manage risks and identify revenue opportunities.
Lesch explained that the growing multipolar world is helping to fuel geopolitical uncertainty as nations like China try to exert more control over the global economy. This is not just among the expanded BRICS nations—Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates—as Lesch said that China is now starting to further push its influence in South America.
“The trend of de-dollarization is a concern, but the best way to counter it is through a strong U.S. and Western economy,” Lesch said. “A strong Western-aligned economy is one of our greatest defenses against further turmoil.”
Lesch said that one strategy he would like to see is for the U.S. to improve its relationship with India.
He noted that improved economic ties with the world’s largest democracy would significantly support the U.S. dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. He added that India has more in common with the US than with China, both governmental and culturally.
“Building upon our relationship with India is huge for a variety of reasons. I think we can get there and it’s in the best interest of both countries,” he said.
A Diversified Global Supply Chain Could Ease Geopolitical Tensions
Lesch added that while geopolitical uncertainty creates obstacles for the global economy, it also creates opportunities. He noted that Crisis24 uses Artificial Intelligence to monitor threats to the global supply chain and economy. The company monitors a complex mix of reporting factors, some of which include weather patterns, elections, civil unrest, labor strikes, corruption, upcoming industry regulations, armed conflict, devaluation of currency, and vetted social media posts from governments and state services.
Crisis24 compiles all the data to provide companies with up to six-month outlooks on potential commodity supply disruptions around the world. Lesch used titanium as an example, as the market saw a massive supply disruption when Russia invaded Ukraine. Because of economic sanctions, Russia’s titanium exports dried up.
“A lot of companies that were reliant on Russia for titanium took an enormous hit,” he said. “But you can’t say that it’s not like we didn’t see that one coming. For two months before, Russia was lining up on the border of Ukraine with its military. Businesses had a two-month head start to try to find other sources. Prior to the invasion, Russia was not a top 10 exporter of the world’s titanium supply, so there are other sources out there that companies could have explored before the war if they were using the right forward-looking intelligence tools, which the US intelligence community calls Anticipatory Intelligence.”
A screen shot of Crisis24's platform that provides in depth analysis of commodity supply chains
Lesch used neodymium, an essential critical metal because of its magnetic properties, as another example. He noted that China produces 50% of the world’s supply; however, Crisis24 has flagged a potential market disruption in that supply. Lesch said companies relying on neodymium could start looking for new sources to protect their supply chain.
“Japan produces only 8% of the world’s neodymium, but it could be a place to start making inroads and connections. Malaysia is just under 7%, so you could start investing in resources there,” he said. “There are options out there. The world economy is quite resilient, but businesses need to stay agile and adopt proactive measures to mitigate risks.”
While there is a delicate balance in the supply chain, Lesch said he is optimistic that diversity in the global commodity supply chain could ease geopolitical uncertainty. Nations could use more diplomacy to resolve international issues so they don’t spook investment capital, potentially hurting their economy.
“Countries are less likely to go to war if everyone is making money and countries have the commodities and security their nation needs,” he said. “Businesses need to look ahead with actionable and reliable intelligence to diversify their supply chains when needed and build resilience. This approach not only ensures continuity but also reduces the likelihood of conflicts escalating due to resource scarcity.”
Conversely, Lesch added that taking these economic threats too far could lead to heightened tensions.
“If nations are completely cut off from the global supply chain and lack access to key commodities, they are backed into a corner. They have no other recourse but to take a harder line,” he said.
While there is hope that global economic tensions could ease, Lesch said that nations and companies need to be aware of a growing global threat: state-sponsored cyber terrorism.
In a panel discussion at the IEFA Conference of Montreal, Lesch said that cyber-attacks by state players have doubled in the past year and will only get worse. “I predict the longer the wars in Ukraine and Israel continue, the more covert action initiatives Russia and other adverse state actors will execute with cyber-attacks, critical infrastructure sabotage, and targeting western businesses. It’s going to get worse before it gets better.” "
60,"Jun 11, 2024","Stronger USD and weaker Chinese demand drag gold, but rally to resume in Q4 – ING’s Manthey","
(Kitco News) – Gold prices are facing new headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar and weaker Chinese demand, but the yellow metal will resume its rally once the Fed begins cutting rates, according to Ewa Manthey, Commodities Strategist at ING.
Manthey noted that gold prices have already fallen by 5% from the new all-time high above $2,450 set in May following the release of a strong U.S. jobs report and the news that China’s central bank bought no gold last month. The employment data boosted the U.S. dollar index even as the Chinese data dragged gold prices lower.

“Gold has risen almost 12% year-to-date, mostly amid optimism for a Fed pivot to monetary easing this year,” Manthey wrote. “Safe haven demand amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as buying by central banks, has also supported higher gold prices this year. However, May’s stronger-than-expected US jobs report has pushed back expectations on when the Fed may start cutting rates.”
“With inflation having remained sticky and the latest jobs numbers beating all expectations, our US economist expects the Fed to push their projections for rate cuts back, so they end up with two cuts in 2024 and four in 2025 instead of three and three,” she said.
Manthey added that if the Fed continues to delay the start of its rate-cutting cycle, gold prices could see a further pullback. “We expect gold prices to remain volatile in the coming months as the market reacts to macro drivers, tracking geopolitical events and Fed rate policy,” she said.
China also halted its sovereign gold purchases in May, ending an 18-month string of net buying, leaving their reserves unchanged at 72.80 million troy ounces. “This marked the first time the country’s central bank did not add to its reserves since October 2022,” she noted. “This has left gold vulnerable to more downside pressure.”

Manthey pointed out that China’s appetite for gold began to wane in April “when the People's Bank of China (PBoC) bought only 60,000 troy ounces, down from 160,000 ounces in March, and 390,000 ounces in February.” She said that high gold prices could continue to restrain demand in the near term.
She noted that investment demand did pick up in some regions last month, pushing global gold ETFs to post net inflows for the first time in 12 months. “During the month, Europe and Asia led global inflows while North America and other regions registered mild losses,” she said. “Global gold ETF holdings rose to 3,088 tonnes by the end of the month.”

Turning to the future outlook for the yellow metal, Manthey said ING expects gold prices to pull back slightly during the remainder of Q2. He believes geopolitical risks are already factored into current gold prices while the Fed continues to maintain high interest rates.

“We see prices averaging $2,300/oz in the second quarter and an annual average of $2,255/oz in 2024,” she concluded. “We see prices peaking in the fourth quarter, averaging $2,350/oz on the assumption that the Fed starts cutting rates in the second half of the year and the dollar and yields weaken.”"

63,"Jun 10, 2024","Forget the Fed’s monetary policy, safe-haven demand to define gold prices - BNP Paribas’ Fabien Benchetrit","(Kitco News) - A growing distrust of the U.S. dollar is a major factor behind gold’s ability to hold critical support even as the market prices out potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, according to one international bank.
Looking ahead, Fabien Benchetrit, Head of Target Allocation at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said he expects gold will continue to move higher as investors focus less on gold’s opportunity costs and more on its safe-haven value.
“Since COVID, the forces of globalization appear to be ebbing. A new ‘multipolar’ dynamic is developing involving de-dollarisation, deglobalization, and international tensions. This new framework benefits precious metals,” Benchetritc wrote in a report published last week. “They appeal to investors as they provide a hedge against both the risk of an erosion of purchasing power in US dollars and geopolitics.”
Uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance has created some significant volatility in the gold market. Friday, gold prices saw their biggest drop in two years due partly to better-than-expected employment data that caused markets to price out a potential rate cut in September.
While gold prices dropped roughly 3% before the weekend, the market has managed to hold critical support above $2,300 an ounce. August gold futures last traded at $2,329 an ounce, up 0.18% on the day.
Benchetrit noted that gold’s resilience is part of a broader trend. While down from its recent highs, the market is up nearly 28% from its October lows and up more than 12% since the start of the year.
“A good performance for an asset with no yield. It does not seem to matter whether real rates rise or the US dollar appreciates, precious metals are resilient,” he said.
Benchetrit added that not only are central banks buying gold to diversify away from the U.S. dollar, but they are also moving the bullion back within their borders. Nigeria, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia are some of the central banks he named repatriating their gold reserves from the Federal Bank of New York.
“In addition, China is no longer accumulating US dollar reserves and is gradually selling off its holdings of US Treasury bonds,” he said.
Benchetrit also said that Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, which make up the core BRICS nations and the organization's new members Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates, could be a new catalyst for higher gold prices.
“If they favor bilateral agreements in local currencies as an alternative to the dollar, a common currency pegged to a basket of assets including commodities could emerge, especially since these countries are the main producers of hydrocarbons,” he said.
In his report, Benchetrit also expects central banks to continue buying gold through 2024. The comments were made before China spooked the gold market after data showed that it didn’t buy end gold in May, ending an 18-month shopping spree.
“Demand for gold from central banks is not weakening, and the repatriation of their gold reserves from the US suggests a rising mistrust of a US-centric system,” he said.
Benchetrit said he expects retail investors to pay more attention to gold’s role as a safe-haven asset and ignore headwinds of higher bond yields and a stronger U.S. dollar.
“Both individual and institutional investors (asset managers, private banks) would appear to be underinvested: despite the high gold price, futures positions are below previous peaks as are the assets of the biggest gold ETF. This situation suggests the end of the rise in gold is not yet in sight,” he said."
64,"Jun 10, 2024","Bulls working to stabilize gold, silver markets","(Kitco News) - Gold prices are near steady and silver prices firmer in midday U.S. trading Monday. The precious metals bulls are trying to recover from the very recent surges in the U.S. dollar index and U.S. Treasury yields, following last Friday’s stronger U.S. jobs report. August gold was last up $1.20 at $2,326.50. July silver was last up $0.365 at $29.805.
It’s an extra important U.S. data week, highlighted by inflation readings and the FOMC meeting. Barron’s says in a story today: “After Friday’s jobs shocker, it’s hard to imagine a bigger event than Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference on Wednesday for shaping the outlook for investors the rest of this year.” U.S. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar index spiked higher after the hotter jobs report Friday morning. The FOMC is not expected to take any new monetary policy action this week. The marketplace is putting odds at around 60% that the Fed will make a rate cut before November.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index higher but down from its daily high that saw prices hit a four-week high overnight. Nymex crude oil prices are higher and trading around $77.50 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently at 4.461%.

65,"Jun 10, 2024","Gold prices slide on USD strength after ECB, BoC cuts, silver longs hit four-year high – Heraeus","
(Kitco News) – Gold prices face near-term headwinds from a hawkish Federal Reserve rate policy, while silver is entering dangerous reversal territory with longs hitting a multi-year high, according to precious metals strategists at Heraeus.
In their latest precious metals report, the analysts noted that gold prices got a boost following two G7 rate cuts last week, but the move was short-lived.
“On 6 June, the European Central Bank (ECB) implemented its first rate cut in five years, reducing the interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, despite higher-than-expected inflation figures from May,” they wrote. “This move followed a similar rate cut by the Bank of Canada which reduced its interest rate by 25 basis points just a day earlier. These cuts reflect Western central banks’ shifting priorities to supporting economic growth rather than cracking down on inflation.”

The analysts pointed out that the euro:dollar exchange rate held up well in the wake of the ECB’s rate cut, but the greenback strengthened considerably on Friday, which exacerbated the yellow metal’s price weakness. 
“The expectation is that the dollar would weaken when the Fed finally starts to cut rates too,” they said. “Historically, dollar weakness has been positive for the gold price. However, no change to US monetary policy is expected at the Fed’s meeting this week. While the timing of the first interest cut from the Fed is not set, the markets currently project a high chance of a cut in September.”
Of course, the big news in gold markets on Friday was China’s announcement that their central bank paused its gold purchases in May after 18 straight months of net purchases. 
“This news may have hit sentiment towards gold, but precious metals seem to have been part of a broader sell off that impacted base metals which were also sold off steadily throughout the day on Friday,” Heraeus noted. “The longer-term trend for gold appears to be higher, but the price is still correcting its recent sharp rally. For now, the price is holding above previous support from $2,280/oz to $2,300/oz. Below that level the next price support could be around $2,200/oz.”
Gold is seeing a positive start to the week, with spot gold last trading at $2,303.75 per ounce, up 0.42% on the session at the time of writing.

Turning to silver, the analysts said that silver’s sharp slide on Friday erased its gains from earlier in the week. 
“The price had closed above $31/oz on Thursday but ended the week below $30/oz,” they noted. “Despite net ETF outflows in recent months, non-commercial positions on silver futures keep building up, an indication that hedge funds and other leveraged speculators have supported silver’s rally.”

“Speculative long positions have rebounded to a four-year high over the last two months, suggesting that funds and other speculators are joining the rally rather than taking profits for now,” they said. “However, as the net speculative position reaches extremes, the risk of a price reversal in the short term also rises, since this often coincides with peaks in the price.”
Silver prices are also seeing a strong rebound to start to the week, with spot silver last trading at $29.426 at the time of writing for a gain of 0.85% on the daily chart.

66,"Jun 10, 2024",Hydrogen vehicles will be the biggest source of platinum demand by 2030 - WPIC’s Edward Sterck,"(Kitco News) - Challenges with mine supply in South Africa, by far the world’s largest platinum producer, should support prices for the auto catalyst metal, says Matt Watson, founder of Precious Metals Commodity Management LLC.
On June 5 Watson recorded an episode of Green Rush with guest Edward Sterck, director of research, World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC).

Watson referenced a chart showing platinum supply decreasing to 2030, as operational expenditures rise and miners close unproductive shafts. “We’re heading into a zone where we’re going to be in a structural deficit going forward,” he said.
Sterck agreed, stating that “it's just fundamentally the combination of mine and recycling supply continuing to run short of demand.” The WPIC projects a negative 1.2 percent CAGR for ICE (internal combustion engine) auto catalyst demand between now and 2028. Continuing into the 2030s, hydrogen vehicles will become the biggest end source of platinum demand.
Events like “Diesel-gate” have stunted the demand for diesel vehicles. Sterck noted diesel’s market share has declined from 50 percent in 2015 to around 17 percent today. Higher emissions standards have increased PGM loadings per vehicle.
Watson said he worries there won’t be enough platinum to meet the demand for the hydrogen economy, forecasting 3.5 to 4 million ounces of platinum available, against 13 million ounces of PGMs that currently go into the automotive market.
Sterck put the number of available ounces higher due to recycling, mostly from end-of-life auto catalysts and jewellery made from platinum. The WPIC sees hydrogen demand for platinum growing to 900,000 ounces from 100,000 oz currently.
Sterck noted that with subsidies, heavy-duty hydrogen vehicles reach cost parity with diesel-fueled heavy-duty vehicles by 2030. However, US subsidies are lower, therefore, “we don't really have a huge amount of hydrogen demand for platinum in our base-case forecasts coming from North America. It's really a China and a Europe story.”
Listen to Kitco Mining's Green Rush to understand and profit from a once-in-a-century event: the clean energy transition.
Each week, host Matt Watson, founder of Precious Metals Commodity Management, will take a deep dive into a metal that will underpin our new electrified world.

67,"Jun 10, 2024",Physical gold ETFs see first net inflows in 12 months in May - World Gold Council,"(Kitco News) - Volatility is picking up in the gold market as prices saw their sharpest decline in two years last week; however, the precious metal also showed strength as it attracted new investors last month.
In its monthly analysis of gold-backed exchange-traded funds released Thursday, the World Gold Council (WGC) announced that global flows turned net positive in May, ending 12 consecutive months of outflows.
However, investment demand still has a big hole to dig itself out of.
“With improved gold ETF demand in May, collective holdings rebounded to 3,088t, but remaining -8.2% below the 2023 average,” the analysts said in the report.
The WGC noted that Asian markets continue to see growing interest in paper gold investments. Meanwhile, European demand turned positive last month, while North American interest in gold was slightly negative.
In a regional breakdown, North American-listed funds saw net outflows of 2.3 tonnes, valued at $139 million. The WGC noted that May saw the smallest decrease in holdings since December 2019.
“Investor interest appeared to be drawn to spikes in geopolitical risks as sporadic gold ETF inflows coincided with upticks in the Geopolitical Risk Index,” the analysts said.
For the year, North American gold holdings have declined by more than 69 tonnes, valued at $4.3 billion.
Analysts noted that while geopolitical uncertainty has provided some safe-haven demand for gold, hawkish posturing from the Federal Reserve, as it maintains its restrictive monetary policy, creates some selling pressure.
Across the Atlantic, European ETFs saw inflows of 5.6 tonnes, valued at $287 million. However, the WGC noted that the market remains mixed as Eurozone funds attracted investors while UK funds saw outflows.
“Inflows were mainly driven by expectations that the ECB would cut rates in early June, as primarily reflected in Swiss and German funds: May marks the second occasion this year that Germany has experienced inflows, and the first time Switzerland has recorded inflows since July 2023,” the analysts said. “However, an earlier-than-expected UK election paired with stickier-than-anticipated inflation pushed back investor expectations for rate cuts by the Bank of England.”
While Asian demand is relatively small compared to the broader marketplace, it continues to attract significant market attention as investors, led by China, increased their exposure to gold ETFs for 15 consecutive months.
Asian funds saw inflows of 5 tonnes last month, valued at $398 million.
“Although this marks the region’s smallest inflow since November 2023, Asia’s continued inflow streak is the second longest on record,” the analysts said. “Key drivers of gold ETF demand in the country were the local gold price rise, which refreshed its all-time high, and continued weakness in the local currency.”
Analysts note that improved investor demand last month came as prices held critical support above $2,300 an ounce. Although gold continues to consolidate in a relatively wide range, it has held critical support.
Looking ahead, a growing chorus of analysts have said that gold investment demand should see significant improvement this year as the Federal Reserve embarks on a new easing cycle before the end of the year.
Gold suffered a significant setback Friday, seeing its worst selloff since 2022 after stronger-than-expected employment data pushed back the timing of the Fed’s first rate cut.
Although the U.S. economy continues to create jobs, some analysts have said that labor market data won’t stop the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates. Although 272,000 jobs were created last month, full-time employment dropped sharply while part-time positions increased."

69,"Jun 10, 2024",Gold price a bit weaker as bulls work to stop the bleeding  ,"(Kitco News) - Gold prices are posting slight losses in early U.S. trading Monday, with silver prices trading higher. The precious metals bulls are trying to stabilize their markets after Friday’s beat-down in the wake of a stronger U.S. jobs report that goosed the U.S. dollar index and U.S. Treasury yields. August gold was last down $2.70 at $2,322.30. July silver was last up $0.45 at $29.89.
It’s an important U.S. data week, highlighted by inflation readings and the FOMC meeting. Barron’s says in a story today: “After Friday’s jobs shocker, it’s hard to imagine a bigger event than Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference on Wednesday for shaping the outlook for investors the rest of this year.” U.S. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar index spiked higher after the hotter jobs report Friday morning. The FOMC is not expected to take any new monetary policy action this week. The marketplace is putting odds at around 60% that the Fed will make a rate cut before November.
Asian and European stock indexes were mixed overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward weaker openings when the New York day session begins.
Reports over the weekend said Saudi Arabia’s “petrodollar” agreement with the U.S., which expired Sunday, may not be renewed. The 50-year agreement was put in place in 1974. The petrodollar agreement saw Saudi Arabia sell its oil exclusively in U.S. dollars, with the U.S. promising military security and economic development. The reports said Saudi Arabia is now working more closely with China, which is trying to undermine the global dominance of the greenback.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index solidly higher and hit a four-week high. Nymex crude oil prices are near steady and trading around $75.50 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently at 4.46%.
U.S. economic data due for release Monday includes the employment trends index.

Technically, August gold bulls have lost their overall near-term technical advantage. A bearish double-top reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at last week’s high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the May low of $2,308.70. First resistance is seen at $2,335.00 and then at $2,350.00. First support is seen at last week’s low of $2,304.20 and then at $2,300.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 5.0.

July silver futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but have faded. A price uptrend on the daily bar chart has been negated to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the May high of $32.75. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $28.00. First resistance is seen at $30.00 and then at $30.50. Next support is seen at last week’s low of $29.22 and then at $29.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.5.

70,"Jun 07, 2024",Nothing has changed for gold except the price,"If you ever needed proof that algorithmic trading has dominated the marketplace, look no further than today’s price action in the gold market.The gold market took two significant hits Friday as black boxes traded only on the headlines instead of looking at the details in the broader landscape. In a single day, gold prices dropped more than 3.5%, the biggest intra-day selloff since 2020. Looking ahead, analysts have said that with this renewed selling pressure gold prices could eventually test support at $2,200 an ounce.Despite this dramatic selloff, the market’s fundamentals have not changed. But let’s look at the two events that spooked investors. Gold took its first hit during the Asian trading session. Data from the People’s Bank of China revealed that the central bank did not buy any gold last month.Looking at the reaction in the gold market, investors now believe that China’s central bank will never buy another ounce of gold again. China has been buying gold for the last 18 months; its ridiculous to expect that this trend would continue without some sort of pause. Stubborn inflation, geopolitical uncertainty, and diversification away from the U.S. dollar are reasons why central banks have voraciously bought gold and will continue to build their reserve. Even if gold purchases become more staggered, central bank demand will remain a solid pillar of support for the foreseeable future.“While China has positively contributed to the level of annual demand from the official sector, we are still confident that central banks as a whole will remain net buyers. Buying has been broad-based, with several other central banks continuing to accumulate gold, even as the gold price has increased in recent months. As such, while central bank demand for 2024 may not reach the levels seen in 2022 or 2023, we still believe that it will remain healthy for the remainder of the year,” Krishan Gopaul, Senior Analyst at the World Gold Council, in an exclusive comment to Kitco News.Gold took its second hit at the start of the North American session after employment data showed that the U.S. economy created 272,000 jobs, significantly beating expectations. At the same time wages increased 0.4%, also beating expectations. At first glance, it was a blockbuster employment report showing a healthy labor market. However, as markets digest the full report, economists have been busy pointing out that the data is not as robust as the headlines suggest.While the headline was better than expected, the household survey shows a dramatic decline fo 408,000 jobs. At the same time, the report also showed a significant drop in full-time jobs and a rise in part-time employment.People having to work more than one job to make ends meet is not a sign of a healthy economy.After talking to several analysts, the consensus is that investors should let the algorithms make their trades, and as they push the price lower, investors and traders can look for strategic buying opportunities. But that it enough from me. 
Have a great weekend"
71,"Jun 07, 2024","Wall Street throws in the towel on gold after Friday’s rout, Main Street optimism likely a pre-selloff snapshot","
(Kitco News) – This week, precious metals markets saved all their drama for the grand finale. Spot gold opened the week trading at $2,325.26, and spent much of the first four days trading in a relatively narrow $25 range. 
The expected 25 basis point rate cuts from the ECB and the Bank of Canada came and went, with spot gold eventually setting its weekly high of $2,386.75 just after midnight on Friday.
North American traders went to bed Thursday night expecting Friday morning’s nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report to be the week's highlight for gold. But the People's Bank of China (PBoC) stole the spotlight in the early hours, announcing at 4 am EDT that they had broken their 18 months streak of sovereign gold purchases in May and sending metals prices crashing through multiple levels of support as algorithmic stop loss orders were filled in rapid succession. 
Spot gold sank like a stone, falling from $2,373.85 just before 4 am to $2,343.68 only one hour later, with much of the move taking place in a matter of minutes.
Then, the yellow metal was trading at $2,333.42 in the moments before the 8:30 am release of the surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report, which drove gold down even further as markets recognized that the Fed would have even less reason to cut in the near term. As gold was already down over $40 at that point, the NFP took the yellow metal all the way down to support near $2,300 per ounce.
Gold saw multiple bounces off the $2,300 level throughout Friday trading, but finally broke through support shortly after 2:40 pm EDT. 

The latest Kitco News Weekly Gold Survey has the majority of industry experts throwing in the towel on gold’s near-term prospects, while most retail traders saw gains for gold in the coming week, though most voted before Friday morning’s fireworks.  
“Two forces drove gold to new one-month lows ahead of the weekend,” said Marc Chandler, Managing Director at Bannockburn Global Forex. “The first, and which got the ball rolling, was news that although the dollar value of China’s reserve grew last month, it did not add to its gold holdings for the first time in 18 months. The second, which added insult to injury was the jump in US rates and the dollar in response to the stronger than expected US jobs data.”
“A break of $2300 in the spot market targets the May lows near $2277,” Chandler added. “A break of the $2270 area could send the yellow metal down to the $2220 area.”
“China rugging the gold bulls like GME today,” said Adam Button, head of currency strategy at Forexlive.com. Button thinks gold has further to fall. “This China news is bad,” he added.
Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst at Barchart.com, said gold prices are likely to move lower in the days ahead.
“While I’m not reading anything into Friday morning’s spike move, a knee-jerk reaction to the comic relief known as monthly US employment numbers, August gold remains in an intermediate-term downtrend on its weekly chart,” Newsom said. “The contract’s short-term daily chart is also showing a downtrend that didn’t quite complete itself this past week. Much will depend on Friday’s close, though the initial reaction Friday saw August take out its previous 4-day low of $2,334.80. Now we’ll see if there were any sell orders waiting below that mark.""
“Positioned in inverse Gold and Silver ETFs as a hedge here, as the market has temporarily turned South,” said Mark Leibovit, publisher of the VR Metals/Resource Letter.
“I’m sticking with up, as support structure is still in place from the weekly chart,” said James Stanley, senior market strategist at Forex.com. “And for the first four days of the week gold held in a fairly strong position until finding resistance at 2378.”
“I think the driver around Chinese gold reserves could possibly be a trap door, and I don’t think the Fed is going to come off as overly hawkish next week,” Stanley added.
Colin Cieszynski, Chief Market Strategist at SIA Wealth Management, was weighing the implications of the jobs report ahead of next week’s Fed rate decision.
“The U.S. employment numbers mean it's less likely that the Fed's going to cut rates,” he said. “It's less likely they'll cut rates next week, and they're really under pressure to not cut rates. And that's been propping up the U.S. dollar, particularly in a week where Canada and Europe did cut rates.”
Cieszynski said this will also have a significant impact on the U. S. dollar, and on gold prices.
“That puts a tailwind behind the U.S. dollar and a headwind in front of gold in the near term, and other commodities as well,” Cieszynski said. “Anything that's priced in U.S. dollars has a headwind in front of it now, because this could boost the U.S. dollar a little bit in the short term.”
Looking past the surprising headline number, Cieszynski said that the most significant thing about the jobs report was its inflation data.
“The most important part was actually that wage inflation is going up again,” Cieszynski said. “I think a lot of people were hoping that maybe the Fed would signal a rate cut in July, but yeah… maybe September. You could still do two rate cuts this year, in September and December, one before the election and one afterwards.”
Cieszynski said that the downward price action from gold could be fairly dramatic, as its run-up provided few obvious areas of support. “It broke out over $2,160, and then it very quickly went to $2400, so the support is in at around $2,280ish, $2,285, and if that gets taken out, then back to $2,125, $2,150.”
This week, 18 Wall Street analysts participated in the Kitco News Gold Survey, and after Friday’s precipitous slide, few were optimistic about the near term. Only two experts, representing 11%, expect to see gold prices climb higher next week. Eleven analysts, fully 61%, predicted a price decline, and the remaining five, or 28% of the total, see gold trending sideways during the coming week.
Meanwhile, 184 votes were cast in Kitco’s online poll, with Main Street investors representing the ‘before’ picture of a relatively optimistic market. 107 retail traders, or 58%, look for gold prices to rise next week, the same proportion as last week. Another 33, or 18%, expected they would be lower, while 44 respondents, representing the remaining 24%, saw prices chopping sideways during the week ahead.

Next week will revolve around the Wednesday morning release of U.S. CPI for May, followed by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision in the afternoon.
Then on Thursday, markets will be watching U.S. PPI for May and weekly jobless claims, with the Bank of Japan set to announce their monetary policy decision in the evening. And Friday morning will see the release of Preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment.
Adrian Day, President of Adrian Day Asset Management, was among the minority who believe gold could stage a comeback next week.
“Friday’s drop after the U.S. payroll report is overdone, and suggests some holders were nervous weak hands,” Day said. “The concern is that the payrolls report pushes back the prospects of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, but no-one was expecting it at next week’s meeting; September was the earliest when a Fed rate cut was broadly expected. A lot can happen twixt now and then.”
“Moreover, the U.S. and the Fed are not the only game in town,” he added. “Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada have cut rates in the last weeks, with a few other small central banks. The global trend is definitely to lower rates.”
Day said that while gold might see some follow-through from today’s selloff, he thinks it will only be for a day or two, and only shallow. “By the end of the week, I would expect gold to be moving up again.”
Kevin Grady, president of Phoenix Futures and Options, was looking at the market dynamics on Friday after the sharp overnight selloff.
“When the market dumps like that, the rest of the day is no longer about the news,” he said. “The rest of the day is people hitting stops, and in that market, it gets into a rhythm of the day where people are liquidating. So when you enter a day as a trader, and you see people are liquidating positions, it just changes the day. People are thinking, are there more stops under the market? Did we hit all the stops? Where's the buying coming in?”
“As a trader, that's what I look for,” Grady said. “I remember standing in the trading pit for years and years, and that's what I would watch for. Where are the stops? The market sells off... are they continuing? When you see another dip in the market and it doesn't continue, and strong buying comes in, who's doing that strong buying? Where's it coming from?”
Grady said that the payrolls report just exacerbated an already declining market, but soon all eyes will move to next week’s data.
“Let's see what the CPI looks like,” he said. “I think that's going to be the key for us. We have to wait and see.”
He’s also very interested in what Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will say at next week’s post-FOMC press conference.
“No one's anticipating any rate movements, but it's all about the verbiage, and the dot plot,” Grady said. “Everybody wants to know, where do these guys all stand as far as their projections and how many rate cuts are coming in, or will there be [cuts]? You saw the ECB cut rates this week. I still say that inflation is hot. Everything that touches, every single person, food, rent, education, insurance, any of those prices. Inflation is 15 percent at least on most of those metrics and I think that these guys see it.”
Grady said he thinks it’s increasingly likely that the Federal Reserve will decide to bite the bullet and raise the inflation target above 2%.
“I don't know if these guys at some point are going to start raising their target a little higher and say, our number is no longer 2 percent that we're going to target, we're going to try to say maybe it's 3%. I think that discussion is being kicked around, and I think that discussion has to be had, because right now, I don't think it's prudent to cut rates. I just don't think it's warranted, but they're in a really tight spot because on all the servicing debt that they have, they're paying exorbitant interest rates, and especially if the ECB is cutting rates, the entire world is flooding into U.S. Treasuries at 5.2%.”
Grady said that the Fed will need to do something at some point. “We're holding up the world, and we're going to continue to pay an exorbitant amount for our debt to service our economy?” he asked. “That's why I think these guys are in a real pickle.”
“I think they'd like to [cut], but I think the only way they're going to be able to lower rates is if they say, our target’s raised a little, we're going to go to maybe 3%,” Grady concluded.
“Gold's chart looks really weak, which is not surprising,” said Phillip Streible, Head of Market Strategy at Blue Line Futures. “If you are looking for metals exposure, copper and silver have better fundamentals. Gold investors should take a bit of a break for now.”
“We are likely in higher timeframe bearish correction against the move up from 19001,” said Michael Moor, Founder of Moor Analytics. “The trade below 24343 (+1.3 tics per/hour) has brought in $122.3 of pressure.  The trade below 24216 (+4 tics per/hour) projects this downward $60 (+)—we have attained $109.6.  On 5/22 we left the minor bearish reversal warned about, and on 5/23 left another bearish reversal above.  These rolled into the (Q) and are OFF HOLD.  Decent trade below 23642 (-1.2 tics per/hour starting at 6:00am) should bring in decent pressure, likely for days.”
“Neutral,” said Naeem Aslam, Chief Investment Officer at Zaye Capital Markets. “Consolidation with a grind to the downside.”
And Kitco Senior Analyst Jim Wyckoff sees further declines for gold next week. “Steady-lower as chart damage inflicted recently,” he said.
Spot gold last traded at $2,294.01 per ounce at the time of writing, down 3.45% on the day and down 1.43% on the week.

72,"Jun 07, 2024","Gold price takes two massive hits, but fundaments remain strong ahead of FOMC meeting next week","(Kitco News) - A one-two punch has knocked gold down to the canvas, but although prices have room to move lower, analysts have said that investors should view this correction as a strategic buying opportunity.
Although gold continues to consolidate in a broad range, the precious metal is ending the week with massive volatility. Disappointing economic data helped push gold prices to initial resistance at $2,400 an ounce mid-week; however, that bullish momentum has proven unstainable as the market ends Friday in solidly negative territory, extending its losing streak to three weeks.
August gold futures last traded at $2,325.60 an ounce, down more than 2% on the day. Meanwhile, the precious metal is down nearly 1% from last Friday.
Silver is also being dragged lower, extending its losing streak to three consecutive weeks. July silver futures last traded at $29.46 an ounce, down 6% on the day and down 3% for the week.
The selloff started early Friday after data from the People’s Bank of China showed that the central bank did not buy gold last month, ending a record 18-month shopping spree. The disappointing news caused gold prices to drop by nearly $20.
While on the ropes, the market was hit with another $20 drop following more disappointing data. The U.S. economy created 272,000 jobs in May, significantly beating expectations. At the same time, wages increased by 0.4%, also beating expectations.
At first blush, the economic data prompted markets to once again shift their interest rate expectations and start pricing a potential rate cut in September off the table.
Although gold has suffered some significant blows, it is not down for the count.
Christopher Vecchio, Head Of Futures and Forex at Tastylive.com, said the employment numbers were not as healthy as the market thinks. He pointed out that there was a massive discrepancy between the government numbers and the household survey. The government numbers show robust gains; however, the household survey showed job losses of 408,000.
At the same time, there was a sharp drop in full-time positions and a rise in part-time employment.
“The data reflects what we are seeing in other reports, that labor market growth is starting to slow,” Vecchio said.
Analysts are also shrugging off China’s disappointing news that it didn’t increase its gold reserves last month. Many analysts have said it's not surprising that the central bank is taking a break after buying gold for 18 straight months. Many analysts see this as a short-term pause.
Michelle Schneider,  Director of Trading Education and Research at MarketGauge, said that despite gold and silver’s selloff, there has been no fundamental change in the market.
‘We still have geopolitical uncertainty, we still have inflation, and we still have government debt and spending rising uncontrollably,” she said. “These are all factors that continue to support gold and silver.”
Schneider added that for gold’s long-term bull market to send, world peace would have to break out, and inflation would have to fall back to 2%.
“That seems a little far-fetched for me right now,” she said.
Vecchio said that his year-end target remains $2,575 an ounce even with this pullback.
Although gold’s fundamentals remain strong, analysts are not expecting investors to rush into the market to try and catch the falling knife. Schneider said that gold prices could easily fall 10% in a normal correction, pushing support down to $2,200.
Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said he is also watching the $2,200 level.
“We may be seeing the beginning of a broad profit-taking from all the upside momentum from the lows of October to the peak in May,” he said. “The current move does not look like one that will end quickly. We should be prepared for gold to dive into the $2,200 area in the next few weeks, which would bring the price back to just above the March consolidation area and correct it to 61.8% of the October-May rise.”
Lukman Otunuga, Manager Of Market Analysis at FXTM, said that while the bears are in control, there is still a chance for prices to recover next week.
“The scales of power have swung back in favor of bears with further downside on the cards unless markets find fresh hopes of Fed cuts. This takes us to the week ahead, when the focus falls on the U.S. CPI and Fed decision,” he said.
Economists have said that while the stronger-than-expected employment data was surprising, the Fed remains more focused on inflation. A weak CPI report could put a September rate cut back on the table.
Along with the U.S. Consumer Price Index data, economists have said that markets will be sensitive to what the Federal Reserve has to say.
The U.S. central bank is not expected to cut rates in June or July, but next week’s meeting could continue to set the stage for rate cuts later in the year, which some analysts have said remains bullish for gold.
“The risk is that the chairman appears somewhat optimistic given the recent evolution of the US consumer, and if the May CPI report shows further inflation progress. We also look for the dot plot to show two cuts as the median for 2024 and four for 2025,” said bond market strategists at TD Securities.
Economic data to watch next week:
Wednesday: U.S. CPI, Federal Reserve monetary policy decisionThursday: U.S PPI, weekly jobless claims, Bank of Japan monetary policy decisionFriday: Preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment"
73,"Jun 07, 2024","China’s shock pause on gold purchases overshadows jobs report, triggers algo-driven search for stops","(Kitco News) – The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) announced overnight that they bought no gold at all in May, triggering a sharp algorithmic selloff in precious metals, overshadowing the blowout nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report released later in the morning and leaving traders scrambling to determine where the selling would stop, and how low gold could go.
The news that China’s central bank broke its 18-month streak of net gold purchases hit the wires at 4:00 am EDT, and it sent shockwaves through the gold market as Asian and European traders immediately began liquidating their precious metals positions.
Spot gold sank like a stone, falling from $2,373.85 just before 4 am to $2,343.68 only one hour later, with much of the move taking place in a matter of minutes.
Then, the yellow metal was trading at $2,333.42 in the moments before the 8:30 am release of the surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report, which drove gold down even further as markets recognized that the Fed would have even less reason to cut in the near term. As gold was already down over $40 at that point, the NFP took the yellow metal all the way down to support near $2,300 per ounce.
Gold saw multiple bounces off the $2,300 level throughout Friday trading, but finally broke through support shortly after 2:40 pm EDT, with spot gold last trading at $2,288.51 per ounce at the time of writing for a loss of 3.68% on the day. 
Krishan Gopaul, Senior Analyst, EMEA at the World Gold Council, told Kitco News that even if the PBoC slows their gold purchases, he still expects other central banks to continue accumulating the yellow metal.
""The People's Bank of China leaving their reported gold holdings unchanged in May was notable, given the level of their additions since late 2022,"" Gopaul said late Friday afternoon. ""This seems, however, a continuation of the deceleration in purchases reported last month. Going forward, we have no indication as to whether this represents a temporary or more extended pause in their buying and will continue to monitor reporting in subsequent months.""""More broadly, while China has positively contributed to the level of annual demand from the official sector, we are still confident that central banks as a whole will remain net buyers,"" he added. ""Buying has been broad-based, with several other central banks continuing to accumulate gold, even as the gold price has increased in recent months. As such, while central bank demand for 2024 may not reach the levels seen in 2022 or 2023, we still believe that it will remain healthy for the remainder of the year.""
Colin Cieszynski, Chief Market Strategist at SIA Wealth Management, said that while the China news was clearly the catalyst for gold’s quick selloff, the market may be reading too much into what may be a one-month pause in the PBoC’s long-term accumulation trend.
“What it says to me is they're not just going to keep paying up forever and ever,” Cieszynski told Kitco News. “They've got a limit of how much they're willing to pay, and we've probably gotten to it. And if we notice since the beginning of April, gold kind of leveled off in this $2,300 to $2,400 area. Whether they're finished buying or whether they're just taking a break to see if the price comes back down and they can do better, it's hard to say.”
“Does it mean they're done, or did they have to take a break for any number of reasons? And if so, for how long? That's a big unknown,” he added. “And that's probably why we're seeing gold come back so much, because people just don't really know. Nobody can really predict that.”
Cieszynski also pointed out that the PBoC announcement wasn’t the only significant data out of China last night, and that’s why the base metals are also declining.
“Copper was going down all night, and I think that part of that was the Chinese trade numbers, imports were weaker than expected,” he said. “It's not just gold, because copper is getting hammered too. It's a bigger metal story as well.”
The overnight slide made for an unusual NFP day as market participants were more focused on the ebb and flow of the trades themselves than on interest rate expectations or the broader economic picture.
Kevin Grady, president of Phoenix Futures and Options, said that in situations like this one, computers lead the way, and humans are left scrambling as they try to predict where the market will stop.
“The market just reacts, that's the thing you have to realize,” Grady said in an interview with Kitco News. “People are not sitting there reading this data and making a decision that, oh, this is bearish, let me sell the market. These are all computers that are reading the data, so all these algorithms are reading this information, AI, all this stuff is reading the data, and it reacts to the data.”
Grady said that when the PBoC news came out, there were a lot of longs in the market, and many of the individuals and firms were still sleeping, so their stop-losses were being triggered automatically. He added that gold was due for a correction, as buying from central banks, and China’s in particular, was all that was propping the precious metal up of late.
“The market's come back a little bit, but you look even a week or two ago, when stocks started getting hit, the big declines, you didn't see it from gold,” Grady said. “The reason why they were declining was because they don't think they're cutting rates this year. I don't think it's happening, and I think that the market started to try to digest that.”
“Equities, I think, reacted appropriately,” he said. “Gold did not. I think gold held up extraordinarily well, we still had valleys in gold, but it didn't tank. And there were a lot of longs in the market. So I think any sort of sell-off just exacerbated these stops. The market hit these stops, and that's what the sell-off was about.”
Looking ahead, Grady said he doesn’t think the PBoC is done with its gold purchasing program. “One month is not a pattern,” he said. “It doesn't signify a pattern. So I'm not reading too much into it. If it's consistent over two or three months, then it's a different story, but right now, I think it's a smart play. [China] can't just keep staying in there. There's a lot of people that trade on that, saying, okay, they're going to be coming in, they're buying X amount every month.”
Grady said the PBoC may be trying to avoid trading against themselves, much as another central bank once did, to disastrous effect.
“It's similar to what the worst trade in gold history was, which was when [the Bank of] England sold their gold,” he said. “They announced they're going to sell their gold. They announced the dates they're going to sell. And literally a day or two before, the market would tank, they'd sell on the bottom, and the market would rally right back up. Literally the worst trade in the history of gold.”
“I think it's smart for these guys to back off a little and try to get a little bit of a discount,” Grady said. “It's a central bank, but still, they have parameters. They're not looking to hold up the entire world in gold markets.”"
74,"Jun 07, 2024",'Crypto is eating junior resources' lunch' - Peter Grandich on how mining lost ground to Bitcoin,"(Kitco News) - Holders of mining equities have still not seen a big pay off, and that's partly due to cryptocurrencies, said Peter Grandich, founder of PeterGrandich.com.
Grandich spoke to Kitco Mining on Tuesday at THE Mining Investment Event of the North in Quebec City.

Year to date, gold has hit several all-time highs, and silver is up about 33%. Grandich attributed the run up to ""tremendous physical buying"" from Asia.
""It's unlike anything I've ever seen in the 40 years,"" said Grandich. ""[It] overcame the paper market, which has a tendency to be more bearish than bullish over time.""
Despite the high metal prices, mining equities have been muted. Grandich said interest in cryptocurrencies has come at the expense of precious metal shares.
""Crypto is eating junior resources’ lunch,"" said Grandich. ""[When] everybody saw this great increase in physical market [buying], they weren't seeing it correspond to the mining shares.""
Grandich also discussed gold versus copper, BRICS momentum and the U.S. economy during the election year.

75,"Jun 07, 2024","Double-whammy puts strong price pressure on gold, silver  ","(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are posting strong losses in early U.S. trading Friday, on a double-barrel hit from a strong U.S. jobs report and China’s central bank easing its gold purchases. August gold hit a four-week low and was last down $51.40 at $2,339.70. July silver was last down $1.207 at $30.15.
The just-released U.S. data point of the week, if not the month, saw the May employment situation report from the Labor Department and its key non-farm payrolls figure up 272,000. That’s well above the consensus forecast for up 190,000 and compares to the revised April report gain of 165,000 jobs. The May unemployment rate was 4.0% versus expectations for a reading of 3.9%.
The U.S. dollar rallied and U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply following the stronger jobs data. The jobs data falls squarely into the camp of the U.S. monetary policy hawks, who do not want to see U.S. interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
Wednesday’s ADP national employment report for May was a miss to the downside on jobs growth. This week’s JOLTS and Challenger job-cuts reports also suggested a less robust U.S. labor force. So the marketplace was especially “wrong-footed” with this morning’s stronger Labor Department jobs report.
The second hit to gold and silver came on overnight news that China’s central bank did not add to its gold reserves in May. That really spooked the gold market bulls. “China has been buying for 18 months, supporting gold’s record rally to $2,450/oz last month. While China may be slowing, we anticipate ETF demand to return to the fore as U.S. Treasury yields fall, pushing safe-haven investors into bullion,” said broker SP Angel.
Asian and European stock indexes were mixed overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward lower openings when the New York day session begins.
In other overnight news, China’s May imports were reported up 1.8%, year-on-year, while its exports rose 7.6%. Exports were higher than expected but imports were less than expected.
The 1Q Euro zone GDP was up 0.3% from the fourth quarter of last year and was up 0.4%, year-on-year. Those numbers were right in line with market expectations.
The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index solidly higher. Nymex crude oil prices are modestly up and trading around $76.00 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield is presently at 4.422%.
Other U.S. economic data due for release Friday includes monthly wholesale trade and consumer credit.

Technically, August gold bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but faded today. Prices are scoring a bearish “outside day” down on the daily bar chart. Also, a bearish double-top reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close above solid resistance at today’s high of $2,406.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the May low of $2,308.70. First resistance is seen at $2,350.00 and then at $2,375.00. First support is seen at today’s low of $2,330.60 and then at $2,308.70. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0.

July silver futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage. However, prices today are scoring a big and bearish “outside day” down. Also, a four-week-old uptrend on the daily bar chart has been negated to suggest a near-term market top is in place. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the May high of $32.75. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $29.00. First resistance is seen at $30.50 and then at $31.00. Next support is seen at the overnight low of $29.835 and then at this week’s low of $29.505. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.5

76,"Jun 07, 2024",Gold price sinks as U.S. economy created 272K jobs in May,"(Kitco News) - The gold market is falling into a deeper hole dropping nearly $20 as the U.S. economy continues to see healthy job growth.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 272,000 last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The monthly figure handily beat market consensus estimates of 182,000.
Although the headline employment number beat economist expectations, the unemployment rate rose again last, increasing to 4.0%, up from 3.9% in April. Economists were expecting the unemployment rate to remain unchanged.
The gold market was already seeing solid selling pressure into the report after data from the People’s Bank of China showed that the central bank did not buy any gold last month, ending a record 18 month shopping spree.
Better-than-expected employment data have added to the selling pressure. Analysts note that solid growth in the labor market could force the Federal Reserve to delay interest rate cuts this year.
August gold futures last traded at $2,333.40 an ounce, down more than 2% on the day.
Gold has sold off as markets have started to price out a September rate cut. Thursday, markets saw a more than 70% chance of a cut after the summer; however, that has dropped to a roughly 50% chance following the employment data.
Along with the positive headline number, the report noted that wages could add to the persistent inflation threat. Wages increased 0.4% last month; economists were forecasting a 0.3% increase.
“Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 4.1%,” the report said.
May’s growth comes as the Labor Department downgraded employment numbers in March and May. May’s data was revised down to 165,000, down from the initial estimate of 175,000; at the same time March’s numbers were revised to 310,000 from the previous estimate of 315,000.
While markets are focused on the solid job gains last month, some market analysts note that beyond the headlines, the data shows some cracks in the economy.
In a social media post, Axel Merk, President and Chief Investment Officer of Merk Investments, noted that the number of people working two jobs remains at December’s all-time highs.
At the same time, some analysts note that full-time jobs declined sharply last month while part-time jobs increased.
Michael Brown, Senior Research Strategist at Pepperstone, said that while the latest employment report is causing markets to adjust their interest rate expectations again, it is unlikely to change the Fed’s outlook. He pointed out that inflation data continues to dominate sentiment at the central bank table.
“ FOMC members continue, unsurprisingly, to place greater weight on the inflation side of the dual mandate, and are likely to reiterate next week that they are yet to obtain the 'confidence' being sought on a return towards the 2% target to enable the first rate cut to be delivered. As such, the May CPI report, also due next Wednesday, is likely to be a much more significant event, particularly after the core CPI metric fell, on an annual basis, to a near 3-year low in April,” he said.  "

78,"Jun 06, 2024",Western investors may be late to the gold rally… again - Goehring & Rozencwajg,"(Kitco News) - If history is any judge, Western investors are once again positioning themselves on the wrong side of the gold trade as the precious metal continues to flow to the East, according to one natural resource investment firm.
In their first-quarter investment letter published last week, fund managers Leigh Goehring and Adam Rozencwajg noted that Western investors lost their influence in the gold market as they continued to liquidate their gold holdings in the first quarter of the year, even as prices continued to rally.
The analysts said the 18 physically gold-backed exchange-traded funds tracked by the firm saw outflows of 108 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024. A further 50 tonnes were liquidated in the six weeks following April 1.
“Western investors continue to sell their gold while Central Banks and Chinese and Indian retail investors continue to buy aggressively,” the analysts said in the report. “With gold making record highs, it is clear who is winning.”
Goehring & Rozencwajg noted that a trend is starting to emerge, similar to the last bull run from 1999 to 2011, when prices went from $253 to $1,900.
“In the 1999-2011 rally, Western investors only purchased gold at the very end, once the bull market was mostly over, and immediately ahead of a significant pullback. Gold can rally with little Western participation - it certainly did in the 2000s,” the analysts said.
Asian retail investors are also getting a little help in the tug-of-war with Western investors. Emerging market central banks, led by China, continue to buy gold at an unprecedented pace. The fund managers noted that India also bought 17 tonnes of gold in the first quarter of this year – as much as they did in all of 2023.
Goehring & Rozencwajg reiterated their view that central bank gold demand is signaling a change in the global monetary policy regime. They noted that these shifts have occurred when commodity prices were dramatically undervalued relative to financial assets.
“Prior periods of radical commodity undervaluation occurred in 1929/30, 1968/71, and 1997/99. Today’s Commodities are more radically undervalued than ever in the last 140 years,” the analysts said in the letter. “Just like in the past, we believe a monetary regime change is forthcoming and that the central bank’s massive gold accumulation signals that the change might occur much sooner than anyone thinks possible.”
Goehring & Rozencwajg said that gold and silver have embarked on a substantial bull market and are poised to see significantly higher prices.
“With central banks continuing to buy and Western investors retreating, the stage is set for the gold rally to continue,” the fund managers said. "
79,"Jun 06, 2024",Will silver hit $50 in June? Here's why China matters - Chen Lin,"
(Kitco News) - Silver's recent surge past $30 per ounce has the market buzzing, with some traders predicting it could hit $50 per ounce soon. This bullish momentum is driven by technical breakthroughs and strong demand dynamics, particularly from China.

Chen Lin, a fund manager and known precious metals investor, highlighted the significance of silver's recent performance in a recent interview with Jeremy Szafron, Anchor at Kitco News. As of today, June 6, 2024, silver is priced at $31.23 per ounce. Lin explains, ""Silver broke $30 a few weeks ago and has been staying above that level, which is very important. Historically, once silver clears the $30 mark and retests, it often rallies quickly to $50.""
China's influence on the silver market is significant. The Shanghai Futures Exchange reports that silver stockpiles are at a 10-year low, and the current trend suggests they could be depleted by the end of the year. Chen Lin points out, ""China's silver stock is dropping like a rock. This, coupled with a consistent 10% premium of Shanghai silver over New York prices for the past two months, indicates strong buying interest.""
This surge in Chinese demand mirrors what was seen with gold last year. Lin explains, ""Last September, Chinese investors began buying gold aggressively, leading to a significant premium in Shanghai. A similar trend is now starting with silver, indicating massive transfers of silver from the West to the East."" Reports confirm that Shanghai's silver inventories have declined dramatically, reflecting robust domestic consumption and investment demand.
The global silver market is currently experiencing a substantial supply-demand gap. Industrial demand for silver, especially in sectors like solar energy, is skyrocketing. Lin elaborates, ""The deficit in silver supply is reminiscent of the 1950s. We are seeing a historical deficit in silver, similar to the period when the United States stopped minting silver coins due to a shortage.""
According to the Silver Institute, the silver deficit is projected to exceed 300 million ounces this year. This is largely driven by the solar panel industry, which has seen a massive increase in silver consumption. ""Two years ago, the industry used about 100 million ounces of silver. Last year, it was around 200 million, and this year it's projected to surpass 300 million ounces,"" says Lin.
The situation is exacerbated by robust investment demand and industrial applications, such as in AI-driven data centers requiring significant copper and silver inputs. China's role is particularly crucial as the country ramps up its acquisition of these metals to support its technological and industrial advancements.
Investors are now looking at silver and gold mining stocks, with the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) reflecting these trends with notable gains. Over the past three months, GDX has increased by about 16%, showcasing growing investor confidence.
Chen Lin is particularly bullish on silver miners. He highlights the undervaluation in the sector, stating, ""Silver miners are very undervalued. We're living in very interesting times, and the upcoming quarters could be phenomenal for both gold and silver miners.""
As silver continues its upward trajectory, the influence of Chinese demand and the global supply deficit are critical factors to watch.
