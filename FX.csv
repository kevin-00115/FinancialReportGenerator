0,"June 24, 2024",No title found,"Gold price trades on a weaker note near $2,320 in Monday’s early Asian session. 
The stronger US PMI data and Fed’s hawkish stance create headwinds for yellow metal. 
Safe-haven flows amid the Middle East geopolitical tensions might cap the Gold price’s downside.  

Gold price (XAU/USD) edges lower to $2,320 after retreating from two-week highs around $2,368 during the early Asian session on Monday. The stronger-than-expected US Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) released on Friday weighs on the yellow metal. The final reading of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will be in the spotlight this week. 

The US economic data continues to show mixed signals in June. The recent S&P Global showed on Friday that the advanced US Composite PMI for June came in better than expected, rising to 54.6 in June from a final reading of 54.5 in May. The figure registered the highest level since April 2022. The Manufacturing PMI climbed to 51.7 in June from 51.3 in May, beating the estimation of 51.0. Finally, the Services PMI increased to 55.1 from 54.8 in May, above the consensus of 53.7.

The Fed officials pushed out the timing of the first interest rate cut this year. Fed Bank of Richmond President Tom Barkin said on Thursday that the central bank is well-positioned with the necessary firepower for the job, but will learn a lot more over the next several months. Meanwhile, Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari noted that it will probably take a year or two to get inflation back to 2%. The stronger US economic data and the hawkish tone of US Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers continue to support the Greenback and drag the precious metal lower. It’s worth noting that a higher interest rate generally weighs on the Gold price as it increases the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.

On the other hand, the safe-haven flows on the back of geopolitical and economic uncertainty might lift the yellow metal in the near term. The UN Secretary-General said on Sunday that “full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah would be ""a  catastrophe,"" per the BBC. Several Palestinian children and women were killed and injured overnight Saturday in Israeli air strikes that targeted two homes in Gaza City, Anadolu news agency reported.

1,"June 21, 2024",No title found,"Gold reverses gains after hitting daily high of $2,368, down more than 1.70%.
Strong US S&P Global PMI data boosts the US Dollar, with the DXY rising 0.14% to 105.80.
Mixed US economic data keeps Fed rate cut speculation alive.

Gold prices reversed course on Friday, moving down more than 1.70%. Economic data from the United States (US) spurred investors' reaction to pricing out fewer interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) due to the solid state of the economy. The XAU/USD trades at $2,317, below its opening price after hitting a daily high of $2,368.
The US economy continued to give mixed signals regarding its robustness. S&P Global revealed June’s Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) readings, which exceeded estimates and topped May’s data. However, the US housing sector continued to deteriorate after Existing Home Sales for May missed the mark and fell compared to April’s data.
On the PMI release, investors ditched Gold and bought the Greenback, which, according to the US Dollar Index (DXY), rose 0.14% at 105.80.
US data revealed during the week highlights uncertainty as some economic indicators reiterate that the economy is still solid. On the positive side, Industrial Production, S&P Flash PMIs, and Retail Sales advanced, though the latter were lower than the previous month.
Conversely, housing continued to deteriorate, while the jobs market, as measured by Americans filing unemployment claims, came in worse than expected. The data kept investors' chances of a September Fed rate cut alive.
Given the backdrop, Gold prices continued to drop, along with technical indicators, pointing to a correction following a three-month rally that began in March and lifted XAU/USD to its all-time high of $2,450.
The CME FedWatch Tool shows odds for a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in September at 59.5%, up from 57.5% on Thursday. In the meantime, the December 2024 fed funds rate futures contract implies the Fed will cut 36 bps toward the end of the year.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price drops due to strong US Dollar

US Treasury bond yields are firm, with the 10-year Treasury note yield flat at 4.261%.
S&P Global Manufacturing and Services Flash PMIs in June expanded above estimates. The Manufacturing PMI rose to 51.7, up from 51.3 and exceeding the estimate of 51. The Services PMI increased from 54.8 to 55.1, surpassing the forecast of 53.7.
US Existing Home Sales in May were lower than expected, falling to 4.11 million from 4.14 million in April, representing a contraction of -0.7%.
Fed officials advised patience regarding interest rate cuts, emphasizing that their decisions would remain data-dependent. Despite last week's positive CPI report, policymakers reiterated the need to see more data similar to May's before considering any changes.
Despite the US CPI report showing that the disinflation process continues, Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented that they remain “less confident” about the progress on inflation.

Technical analysis: Gold price drops below Head-and-Shoulders neckline, eyes $2,300
Gold’s downtrend resumed on Friday after buyers tested the Head-and-Shoulders pattern, dragging the XAU/USD price above the pattern’s neckline. Despite achieving a daily close above the latter, sellers defended the neckline and pushed the spot price to a new three-day low of $2,316.
That said, the path of least resistance is to the downside. The next support would be $2,300. Once cleared, XAU/USD would fall to $2,277, the May 3 low, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie underneath, with sellers eyeing the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern objective from $2,170 to $2,160.
Conversely, if Gold reclaims $2,350, that will expose additional key resistance levels like the June 7 cycle high of $2,387, ahead of challenging the $2,400 figure.




Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

2,"June 21, 2024",No title found,"Gold pares earlier gains on Friday following the release of higher-than-expected US PMI data. 
The data showed US Manufacturing and Services activity remaining strong, suggesting inflation and interest rates will remain higher for longer.
XAU/USD’s break above key resistance invalidates the bearish Head-and-Shoulders pattern that formed on the daily chart.  

Gold (XAU/USD) has reversed earlier gains and broken back below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on an intraday basis after the release of US Purchasing Manager Indices (PMI) data from S&P Global showed activity levels remained robust in both sectors in June. 
Gold sells off after the release of US PMI data which showed the flash S&P Global Manufacturing PMI rising to 51.7 in June from 51.3 in May, whilst Services PMI rose to 55.1 from 48.3 previously. Both results were higher than analysts expected. 
The data results in Gold dropping off a cliff to trade in the $2,330s on Friday. Higher PMIs indicate inflation will probably remain elevated, resulting in the US Federal Reserve (Fed) having to delay the time when it will be able to cut interest rates – a key determinant of Gold price. Lower interest rates are positive for the yellow metal as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding Gold, which is non-coupon paying, compared to other assets like bonds. Thus any delay in interest-rate cuts weighs on Gold. 
Gold supported by central-bank buying
Gold looks like it will continue benefiting from another factor influencing its price, central bank buying, according to a survey of international central bank reserve managers conducted by the World Gold Council (WGC). The survey’s findings found that 81% of respondents thought central banks would increase their holdings in 2024 – the highest percentage since the survey began in 2019.
A large share of the central-bank buying has been by Asian central banks hoarding Gold as a hedge against a strengthening US Dollar. With the Fed dialing back expectations of interest-rate cuts from three to one in 2024, according to the latest Fed dot-plot, the year has seen many Asian currencies depreciate significantly versus the Greenback. 
The trend of using Gold as a buffer against the strength of the US Dollar has been magnified by the increasingly partisan division of world trade between BRICS nations and the West. A major policy plank of the BRICS and their allies is to break the dominance of the US Dollar so that it cannot be used as a weapon against their members (which include Russia and now Iran) in sanctions. One of the few realistic replacements to the Dollar would be conducting trade in Gold-denominated financial assets. 
The split between the BRICS and the West, moreover, has been accelerated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Israel’s war against Hammas, which has divided the world along ideological and political lines. Given these conflicts are not set to end any time soon, they are likely to continue providing a backdraught of demand for Gold, both as a potential medium of exchange and a safe-haven.
Technical Analysis: Gold break higher invalidates Head-and-Shoulders pattern 
Gold decisively breaks above a key resistance level at the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a trendline connecting the May 7 and June 20 highs. 
The break is critical as it invalidates the bearish Head-and-Shoulders (H&S) pattern that had been forming on the daily chart. 
XAU/USD Daily Chart


Gold’s follow-through higher after the break is likely to reach an initial target in the mid $2,380s (June 7 high).
A break above the June 7 high would indicate a probable continuation up to the May – and all-time – high at $2,450. 
A break above that would confirm a resumption of the broader uptrend. 



Interest rates FAQs


 What are interest rates? 
Interest rates are charged by financial institutions on loans to borrowers and are paid as interest to savers and depositors. They are influenced by base lending rates, which are set by central banks in response to changes in the economy. Central banks normally have a mandate to ensure price stability, which in most cases means targeting a core inflation rate of around 2%. If inflation falls below target the central bank may cut base lending rates, with a view to stimulating lending and boosting the economy. If inflation rises substantially above 2% it normally results in the central bank raising base lending rates in an attempt to lower inflation.



 How do interest rates impact currencies? 
Higher interest rates generally help strengthen a country’s currency as they make it a more attractive place for global investors to park their money.



 How do interest rates influence the price of Gold? 
Higher interest rates overall weigh on the price of Gold because they increase the opportunity cost of holding Gold instead of investing in an interest-bearing asset or placing cash in the bank. If interest rates are high that usually pushes up the price of the US Dollar (USD), and since Gold is priced in Dollars, this has the effect of lowering the price of Gold.



 What is the Fed Funds rate? 
The Fed funds rate is the overnight rate at which US banks lend to each other. It is the oft-quoted headline rate set by the Federal Reserve at its FOMC meetings. It is set as a range, for example 4.75%-5.00%, though the upper limit (in that case 5.00%) is the quoted figure. Market expectations for future Fed funds rate are tracked by the CME FedWatch tool, which shapes how many financial markets behave in anticipation of future Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions.

4,"June 20, 2024",No title found,"Gold advances sharply, gaining over 1% amid weakening US economic indicators.
Softer US jobs and housing data increase expectations of two 25-bps Fed rate cuts in 2024.
Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and North Korea-Russia pact enhance Gold's safe-haven appeal.

Gold prices advanced sharply by more than 1% on Thursday during the North American session as US Treasury bond yields advanced to underpin the Greenback. Data from the United States was softer than expected, boosting traders' confidence that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will ease policy at least twice in 2024. The XAU/USD trades at $2,356 at the time of writing.
The latest economic data from the US continued to show that the economy is decelerating, prompting investors to price in two 25-basis-point (bps) interest rate cuts. A worse-than-expected US jobs report revealed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose above estimates.
US housing data disappoints markets as Building Permits and Housing Starts cooled.
In the meantime, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari stated that it will likely take a year or two to bring core inflation down to 2%. He added that the trajectory of interest rates would depend on the economic conditions, emphasizing, ""We are achieving disinflation despite remarkable economic growth.""
Rising geopolitical risks helped the golden metal uptrend. Tensions in the Middle East are rising as Israel threatens to launch an attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon. That, along with the recently signed pact between Russia and North Korea, could increase the appeal for the yellow metal, which is trading near a crucial resistance level.
The CME FedWatch Tool shows that the odds for a 25 bps rate cut for September stand at 58%, down from 62% a day ago. In the meantime, the December 2024 fed funds futures contract implies the Fed will cut 36 bps toward the end of the year.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price rises amid high US yields and strong USD

US Dollar Index prints gains of 0.405, up at 105.64, a headwind for Gold prices.
US Treasury bond yields jumped, 10-year Treasury note yield is up more than four basis points to 4.257%.
US Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending June 15 rose to 238K, exceeding estimates of 235K but lower than the previous reading of 243K.
US Building Permits declined by 3.6% in May, dropping from 1.44 million to 1.386 million. Housing Starts for the same period fell by 5.5%, from 1.352 million to 1.277 million.
Fed officials counseled patience on interest rate cuts and emphasized they would remain data dependent. Although last week's CPI report was positive, policymakers reiterated they need to see more reports like May’s data.
Despite the US CPI report showing that the disinflation process continues, Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented that they remain “less confident” about the progress on inflation.

Technical analysis: Gold price challenges Head-and-Shoulders pattern, climbs past $2,350
Gold buyers are testing the Head-and-Shoulders pattern, dragging the golden metal above the pattern’s neckline. A daily close above the latter's confluence and the 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) at around $2,343 could negate the bearish chart pattern and open the door for further gains.
In that event, Gold could extend its gains above $2,350, exposing additional key resistance levels. Next would be the June 7 cycle high of $2,387, ahead of challenging the $2,400 figure.
Conversely, if XAU/USD drops below $2,343, that would keep the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern intact, and Gold could be headed to the downside. If XAU/USD slides drops below $2,300, the next support would be the May 3 low of $2,277, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie underneath, with sellers eyeing the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern objective from $2,170 to $2,160.

5,"June 20, 2024",No title found,"Gold demand increases from investors bundling into safety as geopolitical risks escalate. 
Israel’s threat of “all-out war” with Lebanon and Russia’s signing of an alliance with North Korea are intensifying concerns. 
XAU/USD recovers and reaches a cross-roads level, bringing its ongoing bearish pattern into question. 

Gold (XAU/USD) price awakens from its slumber on Thursday, gaining a sprightly half a percent to trade in the $2,330s, and finds itself at a technical crossroads that could define the directional trend for the rest of the summer. 
The market mood is placid going into the European session, with Asian bourses showing either mild gains or tepid losses. That said, Gold sees gains from safety demand as the geopolitical global threat level lights up another bar and global powers move their chess pieces across the world’s strategic chequered board. 
Gold gains as geopolitical threat level rises a notch
Safe-haven Gold sees demand pick up as investors cast a worrying eye over intensifying geopolitical events on the world stage. 
In the Middle East, tensions between Israel and Lebanon reached boiling point on Wednesday after Israeli officials warned they had approved plans for the Northern Command to launch an “all-out war” with Hezbollah in Lebanon. 
The threat came in response to the release of drone footage by Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, showing nine minutes of aerial footage of the docks in Israel’s port city of Haifa, which are operated by foreign companies from China and India, reported Aljazeera News. 
A full-frontal assault by Israel would represent a significant escalation of the conflict in the region, something US diplomats are working to avoid. Lebanon has been engaged in border skirmishes and traded missile attacks with Israel since the start of Israel’s invasion of Gaza.  
Russia and China make strategic moves
Gold also sees gains as investors note concerning events further east. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that ensures either country will support the other in the case they are attacked. 
Malaysia also announced on Wednesday its plans to join the BRICS trading federation before a meeting between its Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Premier Li Qiang of China. In May, Thailand also announced plans to join the BRICS. 
The growing power of BRICS as a counterweight to Western and US dominance is concerning some global strategists as it risks fracturing the smooth flow of world trade.
Technical Analysis: Gold reaches technical crossroads 
Gold rallies up to a key resistance level at a trendline and the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), situated at around $2,340. XAU/USD has reached a technical crossroads that could determine the directional trend for some time to come. 
A decisive break above the cluster of resistance would invalidate the bearish Head-and-Shoulders (H&S) pattern that has been forming on the daily chart. 
A deceive break would be one accompanied by a long green bullish daily candle that pierced cleanly through the resistance and closed near its high, or three consecutive bullish candles that broke above the level. 
Such a break would invalidate the bearish H&S and indicate a continuation of Gold’s broader uptrend higher, probably to an initial target in the mid $2,380s (June 7 high). 
XAU/USD Daily Chart

 
However, a failure to break above would continue to support the possibility that Gold is forming an H&S reversal pattern. Such patterns tend to occur at market tops and signal a change of trend. 
The H&S on Gold has completed a left and right shoulder (labeled “S”) and a “head” (labeled “H”). The so-called “neckline” of the pattern appears to be at the $2,279 support level (red line). 
A decisive break below the neckline would validate the H&S pattern and activate downside targets. The first more conservative target would be $2,171, calculated by taking the 0.618 Fibonacci ratio of the height of the pattern and extrapolating it lower from the neckline. The second target would be at $2,106, the full height of the pattern extrapolated lower. 
A break above $2,345, however, would bring the H&S into doubt and could signal a continuation higher, to an initial target at the $2,450 peak.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price sits at weekly highs even as USD bounces

The uncertainty over the likely timing of when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates keeps traders on the sidelines and leads to subdued range-bound price action around the Gold price. 
The Fed projected only one interest rate cut this year as compared to three projected in March, which acts as a tailwind for the US Treasury bond yields and caps the upside for the non-yielding yellow metal.
The US Retail Sales data released on Tuesday pointed to lackluster economic activity, which, along with weaker US consumer and producer prices, should allow the Fed to ease monetary policy soon.
The current market pricing indicates a greater chance of the first rate cut in September and the possibility of one more rate cut in November or December, offering some support to the XAU/USD.
Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian energy infrastructure and Israel's warning that an all-out war with Iran-backed Hezbollah was coming soon point to escalating geopolitical risk in Europe and the Middle East. 
Adding to this, concerns that a new government in France could weaken fiscal discipline act as a tailwind for the safe-haven assets and should help limit any meaningful downfall for the commodity.
Investors now look forward to the Swiss National Bank (SNB) decision and the crucial Bank of England (BoE) policy meeting, which might infuse volatility and provide some impetus to the metal. 
Traders will further take cues from the US economic docket, featuring the release of the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Manufacturing Index, Building Permits and Housing Starts.

Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

7,"June 19, 2024",No title found,"Gold remains virtually unchanged during the North American session due to thin volume.
US Retail Sales and Industrial Production data hint at an economic slowdown, boosting rate cut expectations.
FedWatch Tool shows 67% chance of September rate cut with December 2024 futures implying 36 bps of easing.

Gold's price barely moved Wednesday during the North American session as traders remained absent in observance of the Juneteenth holiday. Data from the United States (US) continued to weaken, a sign of relief for traders who remain confident the Federal Reserve (Fed) will ease policy twice this year. Therefore, precious metals recover some ground, yet XAU/USD is virtually unchanged and trades at $2,328 at the time of writing.
US Retail Sales in May improved compared to April, but they were revised downward, hinting that the economy is slowing down. This data, along with last week’s big consumer inflation report, increased the odds of a September rate cut.
Other data showed that Industrial Production improved in May, followed by a downward revision in April.
The CME FedWatch Tool shows that odds for a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut for September,  stands at 67%, up from 61% a day ago. In the meantime, the December 2024 Fed funds futures contract implies the Fed will cut 36 bps toward the end of the year.
In the meantime, Fed speakers entertained Gold traders on Tuesday, saying that inflation remains high and that they need more evidence that inflation is evolving to reach the 2% core inflation goal.
US Treasury bond yields remained subdued. Still, the 10-year Treasury note yield is down one-and-a-half basis points to 4.215%.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price consolidates amid thin liquidity conditions

US Dollar Index (DXY) is flat at 105.25, a tailwind for Gold prices.
May’s US Retail Sales improved but failed to underpin the Greenback. However, that and a solid Industrial Production report capped the non-yielding metal’s advance.
Fed officials counseled patience on interest rate cuts and emphasized they would remain data dependent. Although last week's CPI report was positive, policymakers reiterated they need to see more reports like May’s data.
Despite the US CPI report showing that the disinflation process continues, Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented that they remain “less confident” about the progress on inflation.

Technical analysis: Gold price remains bearishly biased despite consolidating at around $2,330
The Head-and-Shoulders  pattern remains in place, hinting that Gold prices might drop toward the $2,200 figure and below. Momentum suggests that neither buyers nor sellers are in charge as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) meanders around the 50-neutral line.
Due to the presence of a Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern, XAU/USD could be headed to the downside in the near term. That said, if XAU/USD slides past $2,300, the next support would be the May 3 low of $2,277, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie underneath, with sellers eyeing the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern objective from $2,170 to $2,160.
On the flipside, if Gold extends its gains past $2,350, key resistance levels emerge like the June 7 cycle high of $2,387, ahead of challenging the $2,400 figure.



Economic Indicator


Fed Interest Rate Decision
The Federal Reserve (Fed) deliberates on monetary policy and makes a decision on interest rates at eight pre-scheduled meetings per year. It has two mandates: to keep inflation at 2%, and to maintain full employment. Its main tool for achieving this is by setting interest rates – both at which it lends to banks and banks lend to each other. If it decides to hike rates, the US Dollar (USD) tends to strengthen as it attracts more foreign capital inflows. If it cuts rates, it tends to weaken the USD as capital drains out to countries offering higher returns. If rates are left unchanged, attention turns to the tone of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement, and whether it is hawkish (expectant of higher future interest rates), or dovish (expectant of lower future rates).

8,"June 19, 2024",No title found,"Gold trades flat on low holiday volumes as US bond markets close for Juneteenth-day celebrations. 
Fed officials continue to toe the official line on interest rates, advocating a cautious, data-driven approach.
XAU/USD continues forming a bearish Head-and-Shoulders pattern on the daily chart. 

Gold (XAU/USD) trades in a tight range in the $2,320s in quiet markets on Wednesday. A lack of risk sentiment and low holiday volume caps volatility in the safe-haven asset. 
The US Dollar (USD) – to which Gold is negatively correlated – trades broadly unchanged and since US bond markets are closed for the Juneteenth day holiday, the benchmark US 10-year Treasury bond yield remains stuck at 4.2270%, Tuesday’s close, according to data from Trading Economics. 
Gold edged up on Tuesday after weak US Retail Sales
Gold closed higher on Tuesday after the release of weak US Retail Sales data led to a downward revision in the outlook for US interest rates. The lower-than-expected Retail Sales in May suggests lower consumer spending, which would likely also result in a fall in inflation. Lower inflation, in turn, would result in the Federal Reserve (Fed) moving to cut interest rates.
From markets seeing only a 50/50 chance of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting interest rates at its September meeting, the probability rose to 60% after the data release, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, which bases its estimates on the market price of Fed Funds Futures. 
However, futures markets appear to be more optimistic than recent Fed commentary would seem to suggest. At its June meeting the Fed revised its projections for the Fed Funds Rate higher. From expecting three 0.25% cuts in 2024 in their March meeting projections, Fed officials saw only one cut in 2024 in June, on account of stubborn inflation. The expectation of interest rates remaining higher for longer was negative for non-yielding Gold, as it raises the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal.
On Tuesday a long list of Fed officials made public their opinions about monetary policy. Most towed the official line that more data was needed showing inflation coming down in a sustainable manner before they would cut interest rates (bullish for Gold). Their views are summarized below:

Boston Fed President Susan Collins said it was too soon to conclude inflation was falling. 
	 
Progress on inflation remained gradual, according to Fed Board of Governors member Adriana Kugler.
	 
If inflation figures became stuck above the Fed's 2.0% target, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem would be prepared to raise interest rates. Musalem added that it could take months or even entire quarters before Fed policy wins the battle against above-target inflation.
	 
Lorie Logan, the President of the Dallas Federal Reserve, said that the recent data indicating a slowdown in inflation is ""encouraging,"" but emphasized that the Fed must remain cautious and patient regarding interest-rate policy.
	 
The latest update to the Consumer Price Index (CPI)  was ""excellent"", according to Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, referring to the below-expectations May data. Goolsbee added he hoped to see more of the same in future inflation prints.

Technical Analysis: Gold forms Head-and-Shoulders top
Gold seems to be completing a bearish Head-and-Shoulders (H&S) price pattern on the daily chart. These patterns tend to occur at market tops and signal a change of trend. 
XAU/USD Daily Chart


The H&S on Gold has completed a left and right shoulder (labeled “S”) and a “head” (labeled “H”). The so-called “neckline” of the pattern appears to be at the $2,279 support level (red line). 
The declining momentum signaled by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) during its development corroborates the pattern.
A decisive break below the neckline would validate the H&S pattern and activate downside targets. The first more conservative target would be $2,171, calculated by taking the 0.618 Fibonacci ratio of the height of the pattern and extrapolating it lower from the neckline. The second target would be at $2,106, the full height of the pattern extrapolated lower. 
A break above $2,345, however, would bring the H&S into doubt and could signal a continuation higher, to an initial target at the $2,450 peak.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price keeps range as traders await more Fed policy cues

Investors remain uncertain about the Federal Reserve's rate-cut path, which, in turn, fails to provide any meaningful impetus to the Comex Gold price and leads to subdued range-bound price action.
The Fed last week lowered its projection for the number of rate cuts in 2024 to one from three in March, though the incoming US macro data keeps hopes alive for the first rate cut in September.
The bets were lifted by softer US consumer and producer prices data released last week, which suggested that inflation is subsiding, and disappointing US Retail Sales figures on Tuesday. 
The Commerce Department reported that US Retail Sales rose 0.1% on a monthly basis in May as against the previous month's downwardly revised fall of 0.2% and the 0.2% increase anticipated.
The softer print pointed to signs of exhaustion among US consumers and that the economic activity was slowing, strengthening the case for the Fed to lower borrowing costs sooner than expected.
In an interview with Fox Business, New York Fed President John Williams noted that the recent inflation data have been encouraging and added that he expects inflation to continue to come down.
Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said that May inflation data was encouraging but it is hard to know how much signal to take from inflation last year, this quarter, or the last couple of weeks.
Meanwhile, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said that inflation remains stubbornly high, and it will take more time than many had initially hoped to bring price growth back down to the 2% target.
Fed Governor Adriana Kugler noted that economic conditions are moving in the right direction, and it is likely appropriate to begin easing policy sometime later this year if the economy evolves as expected.
Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan reiterated that although tremendous progress has been made, inflation remains too high and will need to see 'several more months' to have confidence that it is heading to 2%.
St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem noted that the labor market remains particularly tight and that it could take entire months or quarters before policies drag inflation back to the target levels.
The US Dollar bulls remain on the defensive in the wake of the overnight decline in the US Treasury bond yields, lending some support to the non-yielding yellow metal amid absent relevant economic data.

10,"June 18, 2024",No title found,"Gold gains as softer-than-expected US Retail Sales boost rate cut expectations.
Fed officials' comments reveal mixed views on the timing of potential rate cuts.
10-year Treasury yield drops six basis points to 4.219%, reflecting market speculation on future rate cuts.

Gold prices rose on Tuesday after economic data from the United States (US) hinted that consumer spending is constraining due to a softer-than-estimated Retail Sales report. This fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could begin its easing cycle this year. The XAU/USD trades at $2,327, up 0.51%.
The US Department of Commerce revealed that May’s Retail Sales improved compared to April’s data, which was downwardly revised but missed the mark. That data reignited investors' rate cut hopes as the Fed signaled in the last meeting that current monetary policy is appropriate.
Other data showed that Industrial Production improved in May, followed by a downward revision in April.
Aside from economic data, Fed officials have crossed the newswires. New York Fed President John Williams said that interest rates would decrease gradually if the disinflation process continued to evolve toward the Fed’s 2% annual core inflation goal. Despite dodging a question about a rate cut in September, he added, “I think that things are moving in the right direction.”
Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin was cautious, saying he needs to see more data before easing. Later, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she isn’t carried away about just one good reading on inflation and added that it’s not time to cut rates.
The newly named St. Louis Fed President, Alberto Musalem, stated that he needs to see an evolution in the disinflation process before voting to cut rates. He added that if inflation halts, he favors a rate hike, though it’s not his base case scenario.
Even though most policymakers struck a neutral stance, US Treasury yields reflect investors beginning to price in rate cuts. The 10-year Treasury note yield is down six basis points at 4.219%.
Data from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) shows traders expect 36 bps of easing during the year via December’s 2024 fed funds rate contract.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price jumps as US yields drop

US Dollar Index (DXY) decreased by 0.05% to 105.27, putting a lid on Gold prices.
US Retail Sales for May increased by 0.1% MoM, improving from April's 0.2% decline but falling short of the 0.2% estimate. On an annual basis, sales decreased from 2.7% to 2.3%.
US Industrial Production in May surpassed expectations of a 0.3% increase, rising by 0.9% MoM.
Last week's CPI report raised the odds of a Fed rate cut in September from 57% to 62%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
Despite the US CPI report showing that the disinflation process continues, Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented that they remain “less confident” about the progress on inflation.

Technical analysis: Gold price remains bearishly biased despite rising
Gold price is neutral to downwardly biased as the bearish Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern remains in play. Although the yellow metal achieved a leg up in the near term, momentum favors sellers, which can be seen by the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
If XAU/USD drops below $2,300, the next support would be the May 3 low of $2,277, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie beneath as sellers would eye the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern objective from $2,170 to $2,160.

Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price awaits Fedspeak and US Retail Sales data

The emergence of some US Dollar dip-buying acts as a headwind for the Gold price on Tuesday, though any meaningful slide seems elusive in the wake of bets for two rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024.
The Fed projected only one interest rate cut this year as compared to three projected in March, allowing the US bond yields to recover a part of last week's downfall and assisting the USD to regain positive traction.
Moreover, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said on Monday that keeping rates where they are for a bit longer will get inflation down and mitigate upside risks, undermining the non-yielding yellow metal. 
Meanwhile, data released on Friday showed that US import prices fell for the first time in five months in May, which, along with weaker US consumer and producer prices, suggested that inflation in the US is subsiding. 
This keeps hopes alive for the first rate cut by the Fed in September and another in December, warranting some caution before positioning for the resumption of the commodity's recent pullback from the all-time peak.
Investors now look forward to Tuesday's US economic docket – featuring the release of Retail Sales and Industrial Production data – for short-term trading opportunities later during the early North American session.
Apart from this, speeches by a slew of influential FOMC members will play a key role in driving the USD demand, which, along with the broader risk sentiment, should provide some impetus to the precious metal. 

 



Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

Fed officials signal only one rate cut in 2024 via Minneapolis Fed's Neel Kashkari.
Upcoming US economic data releases, including Retail Sales and Industrial Production, to influence Gold price.
Precious metals traders await US Retail Sales and Industrial Production on June 18.

Gold prices retreated on Monday due to rising US Treasury bond yields after Federal Reserve (Fed) officials decided to keep rates unchanged and revised their expectations on rate cuts from three to one later in the year. Therefore, the XAU/USD trades at $2,317, down 0.63%, after retreating from the daily high of $2,332.
The golden metal is on the defensive as US Treasury bond yields advance after Fed officials remained hawkish. Despite that, the Greenback failed to gain traction and remains one of the laggards in the FX space.
Over the weekend, the Minneapolis Fed’s Neel Kashkari discussed monetary policy, saying that “it’s a reasonable prediction” that the Fed will ease policy by just 25 basis points (bps) in 2024. This would keep US bond yields high, making it less appealing to hold bullion as the fed funds rate remains lofty.
Earlier, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said that if the economy evolves as expected, one rate cut in 2024 is expected. He said the policy is restrictive and positioned to bring inflation to 2%.
Gold traders will watch the release of Retail Sales, Industrial Production, Initial Jobless Claims, and the S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) figures.
Data from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) shows traders expect 35 bps of easing during the year via December’s 2024 fed funds rate contract.

Daily digest market movers: Gold price flops on higher US yields

Rising US Treasury yields remained high, capping Gold’s advance. The US 10-year T-yield is up almost six bps to 4.281%.
US Dollar Index (DXY) decreased by 0.18% to 105.34, putting a lid on Gold price.
Despite US CPI report showing disinflation process continuing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented that they remain “less confident” about the progress on inflation.

Technical analysis: Gold price sellers regain control as prices are headed toward $2,300
Gold price is neutral to downwardly biased as the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern remains intact, hinting that the golden metal could dip below the $2,200 mark. Momentum shows that sellers are gathering steam with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) diving further into bearish territory, opening the door for further losses.
If XAU/USD drops below $2,300, the first support would be the May 3 low of $2,277, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie beneath, as sellers would eye the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern objective from $2,170 to $2,160.
Otherwise, if Gold extends its gains past the June 7 cycle high of $2,387, it will be ready to test the $2,400 figure.




Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price stays defensive amid Fed rate jitters

The Federal Reserve adopted a more hawkish stance at the end of the June policy meeting, which continues to act as a tailwind for the US Dollar and is seen undermining the non-yielding Comex Gold price. 
That said, weaker US consumer and producer prices data released last week indicated that inflation is subsiding, which keeps hopes alive for two Fed rate cuts in 2024, in September and in December. 
Adding to this, the Labor Department reported on Friday that US import prices unexpectedly declined for the first time in five months in May, providing another boost to the domestic inflation outlook.
Furthermore, the University of Michigan survey showed that consumer sentiment touched its lowest level in seven months in June and the index fell to 65.6 from 69.1 in May, missing consensus estimates. 
Cleveland Federal President Loretta Mester said on Friday that we are starting to see inflation move down again after stalling and that it is important not to wait too long to start cutting interest rates.
Mester, in an interview with CNBC, added that she would like to see a longer run of good-looking inflation data and that the path towards the Fed's 2.0% inflation goal may take longer than expected.
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee noted that he still wants to see further progress on inflation and that if inflation behaves as it did in the first quarter, we will have a hard time cutting rates.
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said on Sunday that we need to see more evidence to convince inflation is heading to 2% and that the central bank will wait until December to cut rates.
This raises doubts about the Fed's rate-cut path, which might cap any meaningful appreciating move for the buck and lend some support to the XAU/USD amid geopolitical risks and political uncertainty.

The hawkish Fed continues to underpin the Greenback and drag USD-denominated Gold lower. 
The Eurozone political concerns might boost the safe-haven flows and cap the downside for yellow metal. 

Gold price (XAU/USD) trades on a softer note near $2,325 during the early Asian trading hours on Monday. The speculation that US interest rates will stay higher for longer, with the median projection from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials calling for one interest rate cut this year, has lifted the Greenback broadly. However, the risk aversion fueled by political uncertainty in Europe might boost the safe-haven flows and cap the downside for yellow metal. 

On Friday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said that she would like to see good-looking inflation data, adding that the path towards the Fed's 2.0% inflation goal may take longer than expected. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari stated on Sunday that it is a “reasonable prediction” that the central bank will wait until December to cut interest rates. Kashkari added that the Fed is in a very good position to get more data before making any decisions. The hawkish comments from the Fed officials weigh on the non-yielding assets like Gold as it makes the white precious metal more expensive for overseas buyers. 

Consumer sentiment fell to a seven-month low in June, according to the preliminary report for the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index on Friday. The Consumer Sentiment Index dropped 3.5 points to 65.6 in June from May's final reading of 69.1. The figure came in weaker than the estimation of 72.0. Additionally, the one-year inflation expectation held steady at 3.3%, and the five-year inflation outlook rose to 3.1% from 3%. 

On the other hand, the downside for yellow metal might be limited amid the Eurozone political concerns. France's President Emmanuel Macron called for early parliamentary elections after losing to the right-wing National Rally in the European vote. On Sunday, Macron said that Economic programs by two extremist blocks in the parliament election are not realistic, and France is at a very serious moment with major economic issues at stake. Any negative development surrounding the Eurozone or France's political concerns could provide some support to the safe-haven assets like Gold.

Risk aversion due to European political turmoil boosts demand for safe-haven assets like gold.
US Consumer Sentiment dips in June, inflation expectations remain above Fed’s 2% target.
XAU/USD is underpinned by fall of 10-year US Treasury yield.

Gold's price spiked during the North American session on Friday after inflation data in the United States (US) increased investors' hopes of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting interest rates later this year. Additionally, risk aversion, spurred by Europe’s political uncertainty, triggered a flight to safety, bolstering the golden metal.
The XAU/USD trades at $2,333, gaining more than 1.30% after bouncing off daily lows of $2,301. Sentiment remains sour, yet US equities recovered some during the last hour of trading, with the Nasdaq up 0.28%, while the S&P 500 trims its earlier losses, shy of being flat on the day at -0.10%.
On the data front, US Consumer Sentiment deteriorated in June, while inflation expectations for one and five years remained above the Fed’s 2% goal. Meanwhile, US inflation data revealed during the week was cheered by investors, who still bet that the US central bank will slash rates twice instead of just once, as policymakers projected.

Despite US CPI report showing disinflation process continuing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented that they remain “less confident” about the progress on inflation.
Even though the latest US CPI and PPI reports were weaker than expected, the latest NFIB Small Business Optimism Index survey for May showed that businesses are struggling with higher prices and access to cheap financing.

Technical analysis: Gold price sellers regain control as prices are headed toward $2,300
Gold price is neutral to downwardly biased as the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern remains in place, suggesting the stage is set for further downside. Although momentum shows buyers’ recovery, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains bearish, suggesting that the uptrend could be short-lived and open the door for further losses.
If Gold extends its gains past the June 7 cycle high of $2,387, it will be ready to test the $2,400 figure. Conversely, if XAU/USD drops below $2,300, the first support would be the May 3 low of $2,277, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie beneath, as sellers would eye the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern objective at around $2,170 to $2,160.




Fed FAQs


 What does the Federal Reserve do, how does it impact the US Dollar? 
Monetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.



 How often does the Fed hold monetary policy meetings? 
The Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials – the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.



 What is Quantitative Easing (QE) and how does it impact USD? 
In extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed’s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.



 What is Quantitative Tightening (QT) and how does it impact the US Dollar? 
Quantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar.

21,"June 14, 2024",No title found,"Gold continues to trade in a range established in spring as traders respond to mixed macroeconomic signals. 
Whilst the data points to a fall in inflation, Fed officials are more cautious.
XAU/USD has probably formed a bearish Head-and-Shoulders pattern on the daily chart. 

Gold (XAU/USD) trades marginally higher, exchanging hands in the $2,330s on Friday. Asian bourses lacked directionality overnight and mixed signals from the US regarding the future path of interest rates – a key driver for Gold – are doing little to help establish directionality for the precious metal.  
Gold stuck in a range during period of uncertainty 
Gold yo-yos in familiar territory as conflicting signals leave traders guessing. This is especially true about the future course of interest rates in the US. 
Whilst the country’s economic data points to a disinflationary trend, which would be expected to lead to lower interest rates, the central bankers tasked with making the cuts are acting more cautious. Lower interest rates would be a positive catalyst for Gold as they would reduce the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset. However, it is unclear when and by how much rates will fall.  
The release of disinflationary US Producer Price Index (PPI) data on Thursday, the market’s gauge of “factory gate” price growth, provided more evidence of a reduction in inflationary pressures, suggesting the Federal Reserve (Fed) could move to cut interest rates in the near-term. 
Yet the data came after the Fed on Wednesday revised down – from three to one – the number of interest-rate cuts it expects to make in 2024 In addition, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dismissed the importance of the cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data in May, released only a few hours earlier, saying it was only one data point, and endorsing a data-dependent approach going forward.   
Gold price itself rose over half a percent to a peak of $2,342 after the disinflationary CPI release, before backtracking on the Fed’s more cautious stance. 
The CPI data balanced out robust US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) figures on Friday, which reflected a buoyant labor market and rising wages in the US. These factors would be expected to put upside pressure on inflation, keeping interest rates high. 
Gold has also been left reeling after the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) revealed they had stopped buying the precious metal between the end of April and May. It was the first time in 18-months the PBoC had not added to their Gold reserves and suggested a price cap might have been reached. At the same, analysts at Citibank point to continued strong demand from consumers in China, which they say will push Gold higher.  
Thus the overall picture remains mixed for Gold traders as they await the next main data release from the US on Friday, the preliminary Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for June.    
Technical Analysis: Gold forms Head-and-Shoulders top
Gold continues to form what looks like a bearish Head-and-Shoulders (H&S) price pattern. H&Ss tend to occur at market tops and signal a change of trend. 
XAU/USD Daily Chart

 
The H&S on Gold has completed a left and right shoulder (labeled “S”) and a “head” (labeled “H”). The so-called “neckline” of the pattern appears to be at the $2,279 support level (red line). 
Declining trade volume during its development corroborates the pattern.
A decisive break below the neckline would validate the H&S pattern and activate downside targets. The first, more conservative, target would be $2,171, calculated by taking the 0.618 Fibonacci ratio of the height of the pattern and extrapolating it lower from the neckline. The second target would be at $2,106, the full height of the pattern extrapolated lower. 
A break above $2,345, however, would bring the H&S into doubt and could signal a continuation higher, to an initial target at the $2,450 peak.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price lacks firm intraday direction

The Federal Reserve projected only one rate cut in 2024 as compared to three cuts estimated at the March meeting, which is seen underpinning the US Dollar and acting as a headwind for the non-yielding Gold price. 
This week’s softer inflation figures, however, suggest that the Fed could lower borrowing costs earlier than expected, with the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicating a greater chance of the first rate cut in September. 
The data published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday showed that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand rose by 2.2% on a yearly basis in May, lower than the 2.3% previous and 2.5% expected.
Adding to this, the annual core PPI rose 2.3% during the reported month, below April's increase and the market expectation of 2.4%. On a monthly basis, the PPI declined 0.2%, while the core PPI remained unchanged.
This comes on top of Wednesday's softer CPI report, which showed that consumer prices were unchanged in May for the first time since last June and the yearly rate edged down to 3.3% from the 3.4% recorded in April. 
Separately, the US Department of Labor (DoL) reported that the number of Americans who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time increased more than anticipated, to 242K last week from the 229K previous.
Meanwhile, a snap election call in France sparked wider political concerns and should limit losses for the safe-haven XAU/USD against the backdrop of Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East.
Investors now look to the Preliminary release of the Michigan US Consumer Sentiment Index, which could influence the USD price dynamics and produce short-term trading opportunities on the last day of the week.

 



Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.

24,"June 13, 2024",No title found,"Gold retreats on its way toward $2,300 after hitting a daily high of $2,326.
Fed's revised projections show just one rate cut in 2024, a headwind for XAU/USD prices.
Lower producer prices and higher unemployment claims boost USD, 10-year Treasury yield drops to 4.242%.

Gold prices retreated during the North American session on Thursday after hitting a daily high of $2,326. The Federal Reserve (Fed) projects just one interest rate cut instead of the three proposed since December’s 2023 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), aka the dot plot. In the meantime, mixed US economic data boosted the Greenback to the detriment of the golden metal.
The XAU/USD spot trades at $2,303, down almost 1%. US data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed lower prices paid by producers, while the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits exceeded estimates and the previous reading.
Although the figures suggest that the Fed could set the stage to lower interest rates, Fed officials estimate just 25 basis points (bps) of easing toward the end of 2024, according to the dot plot.
Despite that, according to data from the Chicago Board of Trade, market participants are eyeing 39 basis points of easing via December’s 2024 fed funds rate contract.
The US 10-year Treasury note yield dropped seven bps from 4.310% to 4.242%, usually a tailwind for the non-yielding metal that is feeling China’s Gold buying pause.
News that the People’s Bank of China paused its 18-month bullion buying spree weighed on the precious metal. PBOC holdings held steady at 72.80 million troy ounces of Gold in May.
On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that they are less confident about inflation than previously ""in order to cut."" He added, ""If jobs are to weaken unexpectedly, the Fed is ready to respond."" When asked about the US CPI report, Powell mentioned that it is just one and emphasized the need to see the deflation process evolving toward the Fed’s goal.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price tumbles after softer US data

US Dollar Index (DXY) increased by 0.49% to 105.20, a headwind for Gold prices.
US Producer Price Index (PPI) in May dipped from 0.5% to -0.2%, below estimates of 0.1% expansion.
Core PPI in May was unchanged at 0%, below forecasts of a 0.3% expansion and beneath April’s 0.5%.
Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending June 6 rose by 242K, above the consensus of 225K and the previous week's reading of 229K.
Despite US CPI report showing disinflation process continuing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented that they remain “less confident” about the progress on inflation.
Even though the latest US CPI and PPI reports were weaker than expected, the latest NFIB Small Business Optimism Index survey for May showed that businesses are struggling with higher prices and access to cheap financing.

Technical analysis: Gold price sellers regain control as prices are headed toward $2,300
The Gold price remains neutral to downwardly biased as the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern remains in place, hinting that the non-yielding metal price is set for further losses. Momentum as measured by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that sellers are in charge, an indication that once XAU/USD’s price drops below $2,300, lower prices lie ahead.
Gold’s first support would be $2,300. Once cleared the next stop would be the May 3 low of $2,277, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie beneath, as sellers would eye the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern objective at around $2,170 to $2,160.
On the flipside, if XAU/USD soars past the June 7 cycle high of $2.387, that paves the way to test the $2,400 figure.

25,"June 13, 2024",No title found,"Gold recovers on Thursday after the release of lower-than-expected US factory-gate price inflation data.
The precious metal had retreated after the Federal Reserve’s more-sober-than-expected policy assessment.
Gold spiked on Wednesday following cooler US inflation data, however, it later pulled back. 
XAU/USD might have formed a bearish Head-and-Shoulders pattern on the daily chart. 

Gold (XAU/USD) trades higher and is currently exchanging hands in the $2,320s on Thursday, following some volatile moves. The yellow metal remains broadly stuck in the range between $2,270 and $2,450, the parameters of which were pegged out in April and early May. 
Gold has recovered following the release of US Producer Price Index (PPI) data for May. The data showed a 0.2% decline in producer prices month-over-month, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. This came after a 0.5% (revised) rise recorded in April, and was below the 0.2% consensus estimate.
PPI ex Food and Energy, meanwhile, flatlined in May MoM compared to a 0.5% rise in April, and underhot economists expectations of 0.3%.
The year-over-year readings were similarly lower. Headline PPI rose 2.2% YoY in May against 2.3% (revised up) in Apirl and below expectations of 2.5%. PPI ex Food & Energy rose 2.3% compared to 2.4% in the previous month and 2.4% expected. 
The PPI data, informally known as ""factor gate price"" inflation, suggests the Federal Reserve (Fed) could move to cut interest rates sooner than previously thought. This is likely to support Gold by reducing the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal, making it more attractive to investors. 
Gold was also benefited by US jobs data, which showed Initial Jobless Claims for the weak ending June 7, rising to 242K from 229K in the prior week, when 225K had been forecast, according to the US Department of Labor. These further recalibrated near-term interest-rate expectations lower, benefiting Gold. 
Gold volatile on snap revisions to interest-rate outlook
Gold shot higher in the minutes following the release of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May on Wednesday. 
Headline CPI showed prices steadied month-over-month in May from the 0.3% increase in April, and edged up by 3.3% year-over-year compared to 3.4% previously. The readings were below economists's expectations of 0.1% MoM and 3.4% YoY.
CPI ex Food & Energy showed prices rose 0.2% MoM from 0.3% in April and 3.4% YoY from 3.6% previously. This was also below expectations of 0.3% and 3.5%, respectively. 
The cooler-than-expected CPI data led to a sell-off in the US Dollar (USD) which is negatively correlated to Gold.

Gold price itself rose over half a percent to a peak of $2,342 after the release. The data provided a counterweight to US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data on Friday, which reflected a buoyant labor market and rising wages in the US. These were expected to put upside pressure on inflation. 
Fed pours cold water on rate cut hopes
Market optimism at the possibility of lower interest rates, however, was quickly curtailed by a more sober assessment from those that are responsible for setting interest rates, the officials of the US Federal Reserve. 
The Fed did not see fit to alter interest rates at their June meeting on Wednesday, as expected. However, they did radically dial down projections of future rate cuts in their attached Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), or dot-plot. This showed Fed officials now on average project only one 0.25% reduction in 2024, compared to three 0.25% cuts in the previous March SEP. 
“The revised Summary of Economic Projections, the so called dot-plot published alongside the policy statement, showed that 4 of 19 officials saw no rate cuts in 2024, 7 projected a 25 basis points (bps) rate reduction, while 8 marked down a 50 bps cut in the policy rate,” says Eren Sengezer, Lead Analyst at FXStreet. 
Gold retreated on the news, pulling back down to close the day at $2,325. 
Technical Analysis: Gold potentially forming Head-and-Shoulders 
Gold is potentially forming a bearish Head-and-Shoulders (H&S) price pattern. These patterns generally occur at market tops and signal a change of trend. If the H&S is valid it may be an indication that the medium-term bull trend is reversing. 
XAU/USD Daily Chart

The H&S pattern began forming in April and has now completed a left and right shoulder (labeled “S”) and a “head” (labeled “H”). The so-called “neckline” of the pattern appears to be at the $2,279 support level (red line). 
Declining trade volume during its development corroborates the pattern.
A decisive break below the neckline would validate the H&S pattern and activate downside targets. The first, more conservative, target would be $2,171, calculated by taking the 0.618 Fibonacci ratio of the height of the pattern and extrapolating it lower from the neckline. The second target would be at $2,106, the full height of the pattern extrapolated lower. 
A break above $2,345, however, would bring the H&S into doubt and could signal a continuation higher, to an initial target at the $2,450 peak. 


Economic Indicator


Producer Price Index (YoY)
The Producer Price Index released by the Bureau of Labor statistics, Department of Labor measures the average changes in prices in primary markets of the US by producers of commodities in all states of processing. Changes in the PPI are widely followed as an indicator of commodity inflation. Generally speaking, a high reading is seen as positive (or bullish) for the USD, whereas a low reading is seen as negative (or bearish).

Most of the Fed officials look to ease later this year
""On the hawkish front the Fed penciled in only one cut for 2024, rather than the two the market was expecting. However, while the dots shifted higher across the 2024-25 policy horizon, the fed funds rate for 2026 sits at the same level that was projected in March when all is said and done (3.125%). The majority of Fed officials is looking for the start of the easing cycle later this year.""
""Indeed, the FOMC appears to be only split around the number of cuts in 2024: 7 Fed officials penciled in one cut while 8 penciled in two cuts, the tiebreaker was the 4 Fed officials who are now looking for no cuts this year (up from only 2 in March).""
""Nonetheless, Gold (XAU/USD) markets gave back the early morning CPI gains, and will remain locked in on the data moving forward. On this front, this morning's PPI data also came in below expectations, which is once again providing a boost to the precious metals. With that said, Gold has eroded some margin of safety, with the first selling trigger now standing at $2,227/oz.""

The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of troy ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one troy ounce of Gold, stood at 78.97 on Thursday, up from 78.21 on Wednesday.
 
Investors might use this ratio to determine the relative valuation of Gold and Silver. Some may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued – or Gold is overvalued – and might buy Silver or sell Gold accordingly.

Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price turns vulnerable as reduced Fed rate cut bets boost USD

The initial market reaction to the softer US consumer inflation data on Wednesday faded rather quickly after the Federal Reserve said that it sees only one rate cut this year, which, in turn, is seen undermining the non-yielding Gold price. 
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that inflation, as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was unchanged in May for the first time since last June, and the yearly rate edged down to 3.3% from 3.4%.
The annual core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up 0.2% during the reported month and rose 3.4% on a yearly basis as compared to the 3.6% increase in April and consensus estimates for a reading of 3.5%.
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged at the end of a two-day policy meeting and projected the benchmark rate falling to 5.1% this year, suggesting just one rate cut in 2024 as against a prior estimate of three cuts at the March meeting.
Adding to this, the Fed lifted its forecast on the neutral rate to 2.8% from 2.6% previously, providing a modest lift to the US Dollar and contributing to driving flows away from the USD-denominated commodity. 
French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap elections later this month increased political uncertainty in the Eurozone's second-biggest economy and could lend support to the safe-haven precious metal. 
Thursday's US macro data could produce short-term trading opportunities later during the early North American session ahead of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy decision on Friday, which could infuse volatility in the market.

Gold trades at $2,318, up 0.13%, supported by lower-than-expected US inflation and falling Treasury yields. as Fed holds rates steady.
Fed maintains rates and revises projections, signaling just one rate cut in 2024; Chairman Powell emphasizes need for sustained inflation control.
US 10-year Treasury yield drops eight basis points to 4.324%, while DXY falls 0.51% to 104.71, enhancing gold's appeal.

Gold prices climbed on Wednesday following a lower-than-expected inflation report in the United States (US), which increased the odds of a Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cut later in the year. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve's hawkish hold and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's failure to provide a timetable for rate cuts boosted the Greenback. The XAU/USD trades at $2,318, gains 0.13%.
On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that they are less confident about inflation than previously ""in order to cut."" He added, ""If jobs are to weaken unexpectedly, the Fed is ready to respond."" When asked about the day's US inflation report, Powell mentioned that it is just one report and emphasized the need to see the deflation process evolving toward the Fed’s goal.
Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy statement revealed the Fed do “not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.” They added that “the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”
Aside from this, the so-called ‘dot-plot’ showed that the median of the Fed officials upward revised their projections of the federal funds rate from 4.6% to 5.1%, toward the end of 2024. This means they are foreseen just one rate cut, compared to the current effective federal funds rate standing at 5.33%.
Federal Reserve officials updated their economic projections for 2024. According to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), they expect the economy to grow 2.1%, as foreseen in March, while the Unemployment Rate is estimated at 4%, unchanged from the previous SEP. PCE inflation is expected to edge higher from 2.4% to 2.6%, and Core PCE to rise from 2.6% to 2.8%.
Earlier, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that May’s inflation in the US was unchanged compared to April’s data, strengthening the golden metal as US Treasury bond yields plunged. The Greenback tumbled to a three-day low, as revealed by the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the performance of the buck’s value against a basket of six other currencies.
The US 10-year Treasury note yield edges down eight basis points to 4.324%, a tailwind for the yellow metal. Consequently, the DXY edged lower 0.51% to 104.71.
According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the latest US inflation report increased the odds of a Fed rate cut in September from 46.7% to 61.3%.
Daily digest market movers: Gold price stays firm post Fed’s decision

US Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained unchanged at 0% MoM, falling short of the 0.1% monthly estimate and April's 0.3% increase. Over the twelve months leading to May, the CPI rose by 3.3%, below both April's figure and the 3.4% consensus.
Core inflation figures decreased from 0.3% to 0.2% MoM. Annually, core inflation was 3.4%, which was lower than expected 3.5% and April's 3.6%.
On Tuesday, the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for May hit its highest level of the year. The survey highlighted that businesses struggle with inflation and access to cheap financing.
December’s 2024 fed funds futures contract hints that investors expect 28 basis points of rate cuts by the Fed through the end of the year.
News that the People’s Bank of China paused its 18-month bullion buying spree weighed on the precious metal. PBOC holdings held steady at 72.80 million troy ounces of Gold in May.

Technical analysis: Gold price rises as buyers target $2,380
Gold remains neutral to downwardly biased after forming a Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern. Although it hints that the non-yielding metal could be headed to the downside, the Fed’s decision could negate the chart pattern if XAU/USD climbs past the June 7 cycle high of $2,387, opening the door to test the $2,400 mark.
Conversely, if XAU/USD drops below the $2,300 figure, the next demand area would be the May 3 low of $2,277, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie beneath, as sellers would eye the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern objective at around $,2170 to $2,160.

The data suggests the Fed may cut interest rates sooner than expected, lowering the opportunity cost of holding Gold.
The precious metal could experience more volatility after the Fed policy decision is announced on Wednesday. 
XAU/USD continues to bump up against key resistance at $2,315. 

Gold (XAU/USD) shoots higher after the release of US inflation data on Wednesday. Gold surged one percent to trade in the $2,330s after the release of lower-than-expected US inflation data raised bets the Fed will cut interest rates sooner than previously thought. Lower interest rates are positive for non-yielding Gold as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding the asset.
Gold could see further volatilty when the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) finishes its Open Market Committee Meeting (FOMC) at 18:00 GMT and announces its policy decision. 
Gold strengthens after data shows inflation cooling in May
Gold surged on Wednesday after the release of US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed both headline and core inflation cooled in May. The data suggests the Fed could cut interest rates earlier than previously expected.
Headline inflation in the US flatlined on a month-over-month basis and rose 3.3% year-over-year. This was lower than the 0.1% and 3.4% rises predicted by economists and the 0.3% and 3.4% of the previous month, respectively.
Core CPI rose 0.2% MoM and 3.4% YoY which was also below estimates of 0.3% and 3.5%, and the previous month's 0.3% and 3.6% respectively, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
The data increases the chances the Federal Reserve (Fed) may move as soon as September to reduce interest rates. The probability of a rate cut by September rose to almost 70% after the release from 53% before, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which calculates odds based on the price of 30-day Interest Rate Futures. 
The Fed meeting concludes at 18:00 GMT. Although the Fed is not expected to change interest rates yet, investors expect changes to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) or “dot-plot”, which provides a graphical view of how Fed members see interest rates evolving in the future. 
Technical Analysis: Gold continues to retest key resistance
Gold continues to pull back and retest resistance from the bottom of its previous range at $2,315. That said, Gold is probably in a short-term downtrend, and given that “the trend is your friend,” the odds favor it continuing lower in the short-term.  
The next downside target is at around $2,285, the 100% extrapolation of the down-move prior to the trendline break in May, or “a”. 
XAU/USD 4-hour Chart

A stronger move down could see Gold meet support at $2,279 (late April-early May swing low). 
On the other hand, a decisive break above the resistance level at $2,315 could suggest the short-term downtrend is losing momentum and more upside might be on the horizon. 
Despite short-term weakness, the precious metal’s medium and long-term trends are still bullish, and the chances of a recovery remain high. 


Economic Indicator


Consumer Price Index ex Food & Energy (YoY)
Inflationary or deflationary tendencies are measured by periodically summing the prices of a basket of representative goods and services and presenting the data as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). CPI data is compiled on a monthly basis and released by the US Department of Labor Statistics. The YoY reading compares the prices of goods in the reference month to the same month a year earlier. The CPI Ex Food & Energy excludes the so-called more volatile food and energy components to give a more accurate measurement of price pressures. Generally speaking, a high reading is bullish for the US Dollar (USD), while a low reading is seen as bearish.

Why it matters to traders?
The US Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of maintaining price stability and maximum employment. According to such mandate, inflation should be at around 2% YoY and has become the weakest pillar of the central bank’s directive ever since the world suffered a pandemic, which extends to these days. Price pressures keep rising amid supply-chain issues and bottlenecks, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) hanging at multi-decade highs. The Fed has already taken measures to tame inflation and is expected to maintain an aggressive stance in the foreseeable future.

The recent US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which came in softer than expected, could lead Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound more optimistic in his remarks later on Wednesday, a scenario that would be positive for Gold, they say.
Gold to see some buying above $2,333
“We expect Powell to sound optimistic given the recent data, and anticipate the dots will show only two cuts in 2024 rather than the previous three. For the precious metals market, this outcome is baked into the cake, particularly as Fed pricing remains tighter than the Fed guidance itself.”
“Given the outlook will remain extremely data dependent, it is likely that Gold (XAU/USD) investors continue to watch for a weakening trend in data before the macro cohort steps back into the market. In this sense, the latest CPI data coming in below expectations has given the yellow metal a boost.”
“Looking forward, Gold could see some marginal CTA buying above $2,333/oz, and remains well insulated from selling with the closest notable trigger being around the $2,203/oz mark.”

Silver prices (XAG/USD) rose on Wednesday, according to FXStreet data. Silver trades at $29.37 per troy ounce, up 0.31% from the $29.28 it cost on Tuesday.
Silver prices have increased by 15.31% since the beginning of the year.

The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of troy ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one troy ounce of Gold, stood at 78.81 on Wednesday, down from 79.13 on Tuesday.
Investors might use this ratio to determine the relative valuation of Gold and Silver. Some may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued – or Gold is overvalued – and might buy Silver or sell Gold accordingly. Conversely, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.



Silver FAQs


 Why do people invest in Silver? 
Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets.



 Which factors influence Silver prices? 
Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices.



 How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? 
Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices.



 How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? 
Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

Global Market Movers: Comex Gold price treads water amid Fed rate jitters, stronger USD

Reduced bets for an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, along with China's decision to pause buying, turn out to be key factors capping the upside for the Gold price. 
The current market pricing indicates that the Fed could cut rates by only 25 basis points this year, either at the November or December policy meeting, which continues to underpin the US Dollar.
The USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, stands tall near its highest level since May 9 and contributes to keeping a lid on the Dollar-denominated commodity.
Traders, however, now seem reluctant and prefer to wait for more cues about the likely timing when the Fed will start cutting interest rates before placing fresh directional bets around the XAU/USD.
Hence, the focus will remain glued to Wednesday's release of the latest US consumer inflation figures and the crucial FOMC monetary policy decision, due to be announced later during the US session.
Stronger jobs and wage data released on Friday raised concerns that inflation may remain sticky amid a still resilient US economy, which, in turn, will reaffirm higher for longer interest rates narrative. 
The headline US Consumer Price Index is expected to ease to 0.1% in May from the 0.3% previous, and the yearly rate is seen unchanged at 3.4%, still well above the Fed's annualized target of 2%. 
Moreover, Core CPI is anticipated to hold steady at 0.3% during the reported month and edge lower to the 3.5% YoY rate from 3.6% in April, reaffirming stubbornly high inflationary pressure. 
Meanwhile, the US central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged and release updated economic projections, including the so-called ""dot plot"", which will influence the precious metal.

 



Gold FAQs


 Why do people invest in Gold? 
Gold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.



 Who buys the most Gold? 
Central banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.



 How is Gold correlated with other assets? 
Gold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.



 What does the price of Gold depend on? 
The price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.
